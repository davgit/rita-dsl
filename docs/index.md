# RITA DSL

This is a language, loosely based on language [Apache UIMA RUTA](https://uima.apache.org/ruta.html), focused on writing manual language rules, which compiles into [spaCy](https://github.com/explosion/spaCy) compatible patterns. These patterns can be used for doing [manual NER](https://spacy.io/api/entityruler) as well as used in other processes, like retokenizing and pure matching
