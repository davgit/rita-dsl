30181,I will never pay top dollar on a new (overpriced) phone again.
24501,"I got this I-phone and charged it to a 100%, it died within 20 minutes of using it. I can't take it off the charger"
39241,"I only just got it, so I couldn't tell you how well it performs yet. Will update when I do. As for first impressions, the phone arrived with plastic wrap around it. Upon lifting the wrap, I could see the phone had several dings and dents. The screen had scratches, and the home button did as well... A little bit of a bummer, but I suppose it depends how lucky you are. I previously bought a refurbished s5 and it was immaculate, looked completely new. However the S7 had nothing super detrimental and if you're planning on slapping a case and screen protector on it, it probably doesn't matter. Edit: So far performing well, no lag and I can finally open google maps without it taking 30 seconds haaaaaa."
7419,"I like this phone for what I needed. It is sturdy, but doesn't have some of the features I liked in my previous phone. For example, to use the speaker phone you have to press the button each time you want to place a call. I tried locking it in place, but it always times out."
71041,"ORIGINAL REVIEW (5 stars): The OnePlus 6T is near-perfect for me. Last time I bought what I’ll call a “budget flagship”, I regretted my purchase within weeks. I was SO nervous that that was going to happen again. I can affirmatively say, after 4 weeks my fears were assuaged. After 6 months, I’ve found MINOR flaws, but I’m still very happy with my purchase. First, the pros: Snappy, sharp camera (they did “best camera” reviews where it was in competition with the latest iPhone, Galaxy and Pixel phones, and it held its own!) It has very few instances where it shows any sign of hiccupping or slowing down. The “teardrop” camera hole is wonderful. Absolutely wonderful. I mostly use my phone for reading (articles, emails, etc), and the screen is SO tall it’s a godsend. ""Warp Charge"", as they call it. The speed at which it charges the battery is awesome. At 20W charging speed, it beats out the Galaxy S10 (15W), the Pixel 3 (18W), and the iPhone XS (highest speed *probably* 18W, hard to tell). I bought a spare of OnePlus's proprietary chargers to keep at work. Kind of annoying that they're not on a common standard for fast chargers (you have to buy both their brand charger and their brand cable), but who is these days? It doesn’t have any of the nonsense they put in more expensive phones, and the cost-savings brought it down to $579, direct from OnePlus. Now for the flaws: The main thing is the fingerprint reader. It’s fast most of the time. But I feel like I have to push my thumb down extra hard, and it sometimes fails after multiple attempts, especially if there’s grease on my finger or the screen. Still on par with any fingerprint reader I’ve used in the past, and it’s such a minor inconvenience that I’m not mad. I hear that the new OnePlus 7 Pro has a better one, though. Another thing is the vibrator; it’s so weak I don’t feel notifications if it’s in my pocket, and I often don’t hear it. Again, minor inconvenience. Overall, the many pluses (buh-dum, chh) outweigh the few cons. I’m very happy with my purchase. ********************* EDIT 9/4/19: I recently discovered that this phone doesn't have Wifi calling. I had to take off a star because that's a pretty standard feature nowadays, and there are situations where I need it."
2248,"My Smartphone was being repaired so this phone did the job. I forgot how long these batteries run for. Anyhow, if your looking for a cheap and simple phone this is it."
20835,Great I was looking for this im going to be purchaseing this later this week
42468,It's the best phone for me. Great price and works like new even though it is a refurbished phone. I've had no problems so far.
36409,"The phone had numerous issues on arrival, it will not shut down by power button, it will not work as a hotspot, when it will try to restart the flashing apple logo will go on phore 5 plus minutes. It will not download from the App Store unless connected to WiFi. Amazon will issue a refund, the seller will not replace or exchange."
59967,"I was so excited to get this phone. I've had plenty of refurbished phones over the years. Never have been in this shape. The phone was described as refurbished and unlocked. The pictures show it in original packaging, with all accessories and attachments. So you can imagine how disappointed I was to open the package to see a phone and a knock off, scratched charger all alone in a box. The phone has scratches all over the back and the screen. It has been dropped and is chipped on the bottom corner from impact. The USB port and speaker are still caked with someone else's dirt. Really? I paid almost $400 for a phone that someone else has already dirtied? To make matter worse, the phone number listed on the invoice is a line that is never answered and a full voicemail box. *Pictures are horrible quality and don't do it justice. My current phone doesn't have a great camera - one of the main reasons I was looking forward to this upgrade."
4581,I have ordered many phones online and was able to use them when I received them. This phone came to me without a sim card and I had to go to Verizon and purchase one. Since then we have discovered it has a glitch that causes the touch screeen to lock up. It as done that a few times. We had to go online to figure out how to unlock it.
1528,The large buttons allow easier access for my husband in both touching and viewing
81153,I just recieved this phone Monday 8/5/19 and so far so good. Good phone for good price
54097,"Great camera resolution, but the screen layouts and apps for Note 8 are not the best. I hate the Samsung Message app that comes with this phone. Loved my Note 4 Messages App. Why wasn't my old app transferred and my profile picture? Forced to get ChompSMS or use FB Messenger. Dislike Bixby taking over the camera, etc."
67919,iPhone 8+ was in “just like NEW condition” not a scratch on it that I could find and so far it has performed exactly as it should.
79562,"Buena duración de la batería, buena pantalla, tal vez debería tener más brillo al aire libre pero en general excelente, buena cámara por el precio, sonido fuerte, el desbloqueo facial se puede activar sin necesidad de cambiar la región, lector de huellas muy eficiente."
73021,Phone arrived in great condition with 97% battery capacity. Works very well. I upgraded from the Samsung Galaxy Note 5 I purchased back in 2015. This phone is a spectacular upgrade and works in every way I want it to. Totally worth buying renewed over new. I love just staring at how beautiful it is before I put a case on it.
57336,"Well first of all, the item arrived 5 days later than expected.. when I finally got it I found out the phone has an iCloud lock and it turns out I have to pay more to unlock it... till this day I don’t know if the phone works or not because my iTunes cannot activate it. I have Tmobile and ATT cards which specified that it would work with I don’t know if it’s a sim problem or iCloud problem like most people and researc tells me. Total Scam."
54437,Had been looking to replace my old Windows based phone and found this very reasonably priced unlocked phone. With its Android based OS its got me thinking about switching to Android for my Win 7 PC as it gets closer to end of security. The hardware of my PC is in excellent condition and switching will greatly increase the lifespan of my PC and laptop.
5885,Excited all my expectations. Fantastic quality camera.large screen. Better than a laptop . easily plugs into my 52 inch TV with HD.
5812,"Overall very happy with phone, learning a lot of cool things. Only problem ....... need more battery life! Other than that, wish I had got this phone sooner. Way better than overrated iPhone."
894,"I was really excited when i received this phone so when i opened it i discovered that the battery did NOT go with this phone so i called the net 10 co and told them about a problem with a product and they sent me out a new battery and when i received it, it was still the wrong battery so i instantly became angered so now i am trying to find the CORRECT battery."
42399,"The phone lasted all of 5 months and then died. Tried contacting the seller with no response and Amazon gave me th run-around until I gave up and too it as a loss. The phone itself was awesome, for the time I had it."
51911,"Been using this phone 6 months now. Battery life is AMAZING!! I can go 2 plus days without a charge. I normally juice it a little in my car on the way home, hut that's about 15 mins worth of charge. It does take a while to charge from empty as the battery is so big. Processing speed is good for daily use. Facebook, Snapchat, messenger, all work well. Video recording in Snapchat is a little slow, but plays fine. **I do not play games on this phone** But would not recommend for a gamer phone as I feel it would be sluggish with intensive games. Streaming video is excellent. As is the front facing camera. This phone was built for selfies. 6 months in, updates to apps has slowed it down just a bit, nothing to get bent out of shape over. Battery life is still PHENOMENAL!! I did buy a case to protect it, but at this price I will keep it a year and get another newer one. No cracks on the screen or scratch's to date. Phone is a little on the heavy side, but to me that communicates ""well made."" Very happy with this phone and will be buying the newer version in another 6 months or so. I hope this helps someone make a decision"
23891,Perfect condition- like new. Works great! Was repackaged like new. Very happy with this purchase
63038,First time not having an iPhone and it sure is confusing but the camera is great and it works perfectly for my music so I've been pretty happy so far. Music sounds great through the speaker. Battery isn't the best but I charge my phone wherever I am anyways.
45632,Got the phone for my kid. Tried to use it for the month only to have constant problems with it Turing off randomly. Took it to an authorized apple repair store and found out the phone has been submerged under water. Tried to return it but it’s out of the return window. Crap phone and now I’m out the cost of the phone and the SIM card.
18303,"My husband and I ordered this phone, one for each of us. It didn't say anything about being refurbished and it had a button to select buy new. So we decided to go with it. We get our phones and my husband's battery starts to constantly loose charge at different levels and different times. He decided to replace the battery, which wasn't an easy task, and the battery in the phone has a sticker on it saying refurbished. My phone doesn't download the system update and I am going to have to go to a store and see if they can get it work. The first clie that something was wrong was when the Verizon store said that the serial numbers for both phones showed them as black, but they were listed (and arrived as) white. We both feel that we were lied to and were deceived."
19009,It freezes and erases my contacts i check on line and found out these models do this all the time
64381,I did a TON of research before buying this phone as I wanted to make sure I would have a good dependable device. This phone marked off most of my checklist and I will admit I was a little nervous ordering this due to some of the reviews saying the device didn't work. I have Metro PCS and when I received the phone earlier today I called Metro customer service and they updated the IMEI and charged $16 to switch my number to this phone. After that I was able to put my SIM card in and it's working perfectly. Though this phone is Android it looks and feels like an iPhone which I love coming from being an iOS user for 6 years+. I would highly recommend this phone.
4775,This phone replaces the same model that I loved. I am very pleased with the windows format. It is easy to work with and use.
58314,I bought this phone for my law firm after my iPhone 6+ died. I doubt I'll buy another new phone again after learning about Amazon's refurbished iPhones.
22515,"Slightly used, slight scuffs on the plastic trim around the face, but honestly it's in great shape for paying HALF the cost of a new one. Great solution for me since I broke the screen on my last S6 Active and a screen replacement costs about 200 bucks...for the 70 bucks more I got a phone that is in great shape!!"
29694,"The Phone itself is great I love the Galaxy phones, HOWEVER, the description of item is so vague and inaccurate, I'm considering switching it, with all the annoying network compatibility issues it brought. I'm on AT&T, but the phone I recieved is a Verizon brand- no where does it mention it in the item description. Also, before purchasing I read reviews on this and was under the impression I'm buying an unlocked AT&T brand phone or at least one that is compatible with my network. Nope. So now, I have issues with voicemail, caller ID, MMS doesnt work at all or takes forever to download. I'd give less starts but the rating is for the seller, not the phone. It works great as a phone but not on AT&T networks, and came loaded with Verizon crap."
27936,"This phone is fake. Got it and in less than a month it started to act up. It got hot as if the battery will explode, blackout all the time. So disappointed. No star for bad product waste of money."
3214,"Got this phone for my girlfriend for $49 and we have both been nothing but impressed by it. She wanted a small Android phone, but didn't want to sacrifice screen size, features or power. We evaluated what was on the market and went for the Razr M. This phone has definitely made her happy. iPhone's have become the phone most people want when they don't want a massive smartphone in their pocket. The Razr M brings a viable Android back into this space: Size Comparison to iPhone: Razr M Dimensions: 60.9mm(x) 122.5mm(y) 8.3mm (z) iPhone 4S Dimentions: 58.6mm(x) 115.2mm(y) 9.3mm (z) iPhone 5 Dimentions: 58.6mm(x) 123.8mm(y) 7.6mm (z) Screen Size: Razr M: 4.3"" iPhone 4S: 3.5"" iPhone 5: 4.0"" Weight: Razr M: 126g iPhone 4S: 140g iPhone 5: 112g Software: Android 4.1: It was ready for a Jelly Bean update out of the box. Smart Actions: She'll never use them, but I would and I think it's a great addition by Motorola. Circle Widget: Attractive way to display data. She loves it. I have to admit, it looks pretty good. Hardware: Screen: I was worried about the screen based on the technology used, but it looks gorgeous. Radio: I've sat next to her in crap locations while my phone (S3) was on 1X and her phone was on 3G. NFC: NFC makes me happy. Is great for transmitting small bits of data (phones back to back or NFC stickers) and setting up triggered tasks based on device placement (NFC Stickers). Stick an NFC sticker to your GPS dock and have the phone automatically go into navigation mode. To me, NFC alone makes this better than any phone without it. iPhones, I'm looking at you. Verizon's blocking of Google Wallet however, limits the full potential of NFC for now and makes me sad. Camera: The rear-facing camera isn't bad by any means, but it that impressive either if you've used recent phones. I'm pretty sure it uses the same chipset I've seen in phones with better cameras though, so it might get better with an update. The front-facing camera steps things down a notch to the .3 megapixels that I had hoped we'd all gotten past. Don't expect to be taking great self portraits without a mirror. Battery: The 2000 mAh Li Ion is incredible. It keeps this device powered long after most phones (that aren't the Razr Maxx) will die. The Jelly Bean update does lower battery life a bit, probably because of Google Now more than anything, but it still has better battery life than almost any other device. Overall: The phone is a great compact size with a nice crisp 4.3"" display. You're not getting a ""retina"" display, but the only thing you'll probably ever feel like they skimped on is the front-facing camera. I highly recommend this phone and at times am slightly jealous of my gf. My next phone may be a Motorola."
63725,"Good item and good seller. T.Y!! Included in pack : headphone, cover protection, adaptor usbc/usb, good battery"
47642,"Of course since my old Samsung was an S5, it took a bit of learning. The phone it's self works great. While I hesitated because it was a refurb, it works as promised. Very pleased with it. Just wish I could have plugged it into my head and understood all it did. :)"
62211,Great phone with a lot of features and has a good battery time
72551,This is my phone now. Works great. Everything is as advertised.
2510,My husband is 90 and does not handle change well. So I sought the same model phone that he has used for years. The phones works on 3G. I took it to Verizon and they told me they are moving to 5G and won't activate any new phones using 3G. I would have thought that the seller would know this and I was upset that I had to search for a similar phone that was simple yet used 4G.
8848,I LOVE my GN3! The screen is huge and beautiful! So clear. I've only had it a couple of weeks so still have much to learn. No regrets!
5206,Great phone! I recommend it to anyone. I am not a high tech person and this phone is very user friendly!
71585,"I've only had the phone for a couple of weeks at this point, but so far so good! Bought from Extreme Tech Distribution and the phone came in perfect condition (no scratches, blemishes, etc.). It turned right on and worked immediately after inserting the SIM card (Verizon). The only included accessory was the phone charger, but it all works. No complaints so far."
40892,"It locks up also and sometimes won't take a charge, but will do until I'm ready for an upgrade"
27082,"I couldn't afford a brand new phone, I have straight talk and can't pay 300-500 out of pocket so I took a chance on a refurbished one. Came in good condition. The battery doesn't last as long as I expected, I'm sure because it's refurbished. Still get a good day and a half out of it though... Only real complaint is that the speakers seem... Fuzzy? ONLY when recording a video though. The phone speakers are fine but when I record something with this device and replay it, it sounds like I cranked the bass. Overall, good phone for $180 vs however much it costs brand new"
17796,"Installed project f1 sim, turned it on and haven't turned it off. Transferred everything from previous phone, connected my server. And used small amounts of data from WiFi and cell tower for a test run. The phone is very nice too. 😎 I'm 82yrs old so age should not be a restriction when choosing."
8734,"I chose Note3 cuz Note4 doesnt have USB3.0 cuz the pen and USB3.0 are the most thing that I care I think that it is pretty good deal but sometime I feel this phone is not really optimized well cuz I have lag and freezing frequently So at the end I returned all But for the price, it is a good deal"
33306,"So far so good... Great packaging... Recived on time. Only issue i dnt like personally is a built in battery nd doesnt stay charged very long 2 hrs at the most with a full charge if im not using it frequently or apps arent open. Had a problem connecting my Internet connection thru company i have my plan with(cricket) but this is the second day having it up nd running and its working fine. Noticed an eco today when i was in a call so hopefully it doesn't continue or that would be good.. LOVE THE LOOK FEEL AND 6"" SCREEN AND SPEAKER IS GREAT AS WELL AS CAMERA"
33016,"this is by far the worst buying experience i have ever had with sony and with amazon..i have baught this phone but have never work,now that i have try all my best to keep it ,its say that on the return policy have expire... what will i do with a phone wich does not work??????"
41731,"Very excited at first then after less than 60 days it completely stopped working. The seller was not helpful at all and basically said tough crap. I had purchased the extended warranty which doesn't help at all because it only takes effect after 24 months. The seller said to contact the manufacturer. So I called Google. Since it was purchased on Amazon they won't help me. So I'm out $300 and have no phone. Next time I'll just go to Verizon and pay 3x as much. But at least I know if something happens to the phone, they won't screw me over."
51998,"This phone is a great value. Nice big screen, incredible battery life and and cameras you can use. It manages 3 or 4 days of heavy use which out a charge and that puts it into a class of its own."
38720,this phone i give you gift my daughter.she realy love you
15901,ill just keep saving i have only seen one in real life one time.Thankyou soo much this dream come true for me. this phone wonderful ive been fighting cancer it can take my heart rate has alot health orientated features built in like a pedometer and the heart monitor is real i chart calories too. 1 problem on the att one took me awhile to figure it out it work with net tracfone straight talk any sim card but the apn needs to be set just right its under setting then mobile data there's a menu you want access points there you set up your apn for what ever sim card company you use i know it says net ten but this site covers the apn values you need. for your data to work on the phone. [...]
4524,"I like this phone but as someone else has mentioned it is not completely unlocked. Do a search on: ""Nokia Lumia 520 will no longer tether after updating to Windows 8.1 Phone"" If tethering or internet sharing is important to you be forewarned. Although some had said you can configure your phone to work with your carrier. Expect lengthy calls to tech support requiring persistence. I expect it will be fixed in future releases but some believe the phone has been intentionally crippled. I am now debating whether to return the phone. My only problem is that I do need internet sharing..."
59689,"Not a particularly effective frisbee, works better as a personal communication device."
27505,Great refurbished phone. Particularly good for child's phone.
2916,"Normally most of the items I've purchased on Amazon has expected results but this order takes the cake! Before buying this, I read the reviews and 4 out of 5 people were praising this product. I decided to buy this for my husband for Christmas since he needed a new phone. My plan on my phone was about to expire at the time so we decided we would just rely on this phone. BIG MISTAKE! The phone came in on time. Looked nice and everything came with it as promised. When we went to buy a monthly prepaid plan for it, the phone wouldn't recognize that the phone had a sim in it. That was over $50 down the toilet. The company we were trying to use sent us another SIM card and it didn't work either; phone still wouldn't recognize it. Desperate and in extreme need for a working phone since we have a 2 year old in the house, we took our rent money and bought a prepaid Verizon plan. Unfortunately that didn't work either. As a result we are sending the phone back for a refund. I just hate that it took us 3 sim cards and over $100 spent to realize this is a faulty product. I can't imagine how the seller didn't know this! We finally did what we should have done and just bought another plan for my phone but I just hate that my husband has to go without a phone again. He's a delivery driver and was really relying on this phone. Now we have to wait until tax season to get another. This time of the year, most people are in a financially bind. I usually don't do reviews on here but felt the need to on this one to warn people. Don't buy this product!!! Shop elsewhere; this is truely a waste of money. The phone won't activate and it won't recognize SIM cards. Don't unintentionally waste money like we did before you realize that. Just take my word for it; look elsewhere!"
74020,Greatest phone purchase I've made. The near stock Android and the fact that it works so seem less with my work computer is key. Love the Moto action gestures. The night feature and the well being feature.
75735,This is an amazing phone. I am glad I bought it and at a fantastic price. The packaging was not what I expected. And the headphones were not the original ones that came with the phone but everything else seems to be fantastic.
608,"the phone was what I wanted all but the writng on the screen about texting is still on there, so I 'm giong to have to take it to the A&T store to get it remove or than that I love my phone."
77069,"It’s fast, it works fairly well. Takes good photos, runs most games no problem. Only issue is the international version does not support some of the frequencies used by carriers in the US so I get less reliable signal in less urban areas that use those frequencies. This version only works on GSM networks like t-Mobil and AT&T. No sprint or Verizon. The double SIM is a nice feature too as I have two lines one work one personal, this allows me to keep both numbers on one phone and automatically switches between carriers if the signal is stronger I believe. I haven’t tested it yet."
4235,"It was really nice and very slim if it wasn't for the phone being defective , the screen would freeze and it would turn on and off by itself, My Verizon carrier tried for 30 minutes to fix the problem but in the end they said it was defective and to return it. I'm pretty sure I would have kept it, returned it and went with Samsung."
20241,"I like that the phone was user friendly, mostly didn't like the memory capacity. But works very well for the price"
61435,"My phone is shot already. I loved the storage, but throughout my use of the phone it would randomly shut down or freeze up even though I have plenty of storage space left"
56300,"Bought two Galaxy S8s and they were as new upon arrival and my wife and I have been extremely happy with the phones, the price and the overall experience. Would not hesitate to use again or to recommend to others."
68426,"So everything seems to be working, only issue that the charger it came in the phone message looks like it doesn't belong to it."
43694,Phone was determined by more than one Sprint corporate store to be unprogrammable and DOA out of the box. Buyer beware!
46591,Less than a month owning. Battery overheats. Shuts down even with a full charge. Came with a cracked backing.
53475,It's a decent phone it self . The screen is great for not breaking but it gets images burnt in very easy . And Moto(Lenovo) is horrible as a company for updates and keeping it's customer in the know.
46890,Awesome product no issues and it's fully unlocked. I am loving it
55178,Perfect! I was very nervous buying an iPhone on Amazon but it's perfect! It's just like brand new but way cheaper. I will definitely be buying my next phone here too!
30679,"Venia todo desgastado el botón, no es nuevo de fábrica."
56418,I was was extremely pleased with the quality of my purchase (Note 8). There's not one scratch on it...it looks and performs like a brand new phone. I had read the complaints about how it didn't come with a cable to transfer everything from my old phone to my new phone. I took both to my Verizon Store and they took care of it. I'm so happy with it!!! I will definitely purchase from this group again. They shipped fast and everything was as stated.
41393,"Phone was impeccable. Battery life fantastic and the phone was as described. Headset is broken in one ear after only a handful of uses. Overall, very pleased."
2135,"Worst purchase ever. First of all, we did not receive this phone - we received an Omnia, because apparently, it is considered the ""same phone."" So we dealt with it, since I had ordered it for my husband for Christmas. To this day, it will receive zero media content, as in he can neither send nor receive pictures or files of any sort, and three-quarters of the time it will not send a text message. It gets almost no service ANYWHERE AT ALL and has left my husband frustrated beyond belief. The only reason we still have it because we cannot afford to buy a different one right now. This is by far the worst phone we have ever had. Really, really awful, and I just get mad every time I think about being stuck with it."
59395,I just got my Sony esperia L2 android phone 📱 and I love it I've never had a Sony phone before. Works great easy to use and tons of features for a awesome price
54417,"Not expecting much from this phone since the specs aren't great at all, not sure why ppl expect it to perform like a iPhone8... It is a slow phone but as a phone for my senior dad who only knows how to call and read a photo text, use google voice search, and maybe another 5-10 apps max this is a great phone. It's loud, vibrate function is strong, screen is bright and clear enough, it's lightweight, and the battery last closer to those old school GSM phones (2-3 days!). And best part is no worries if dad drops and breaks it, the price point is almost disposable and it gives dad assurance that he's not going to lose $500 if he break/drop something like he did with his old iPhone."
79863,"Just wow!!!! I leave my house at 8 and arrive home around 7and 8 and I still have over 30% of battery. Also, the phone is really good for the price and the camera is not bad at all. I will buy one of this for my mother for sure"
27052,it has no sim card so i can get it activated with out a sim card
6784,"Have to give 2 stars. This was a nice phone at first, but after about 3 months, I was using the phone and it just made a loud POP! I noticed shortly after that there was a single clean break down the center face of the screen. I chatted with Motorola and they said they had repairs starting at $100, no warranty coverage."
82326,What a phone 📱! This is everything that I wanted and needed in a phone
42347,"AT and T cannot activate this phone . I wasted my money, That put a bad taste in my mouth . I'm mad. Its maybe my fault . I thought I was ordering a new phone not a used phone . I will not do that again. Now I'm stuck with a phone that I cant use."
5113,very much to my liking and expectationsthe phone is flawless works great with my boost mobile highly recommend doing business with you again.
75687,I purchased the S10 and I'm extremely happy with it!!! The package came just as described including a pair of headphones. The battery life easily lasts all day with plenty to spare. The fingerprint reader is pretty accurate and becomes better the more you use it. Its extremely fast with a fabulous camera and so many great features! Highly recommend!
47215,Great phone. works great. Big phone. Battery lasts me all night at work. Works great for gophone AT&T. Good service. A+++
25669,Hi l buy this phone one is stop work l want to return or exchange. But l do not how can do it
1677,"Even though the ad read that it was Revol compatible, my Revol store was unable to active this particular Samsung model. Guess I'm stuck with it unless I change to Verizon. Too bad."
78067,"I was afraid about this, but now, nothing at all, excelent product and perfect conditions. Just to say about delivery, its slow. U have to wait"
48851,I bought for my 16 year old niece she loved it work.
75697,I expected a great phone and it didn't disappoint. I have the S10E.
36694,"Phone came in very good condition (nothing that would make it look like it wasn't brand new except for one small barely noticeable scratch on the metal) and I've been very happy with the performance of the phone (I upgraded from an iPhone 5) - most notably, the phone is super fast and the battery life is a HUGE improvement!"
33511,"Good phone, I have had some of the most annoying issues with Bluetooth connectivity. My last phone (an Asus Zenfone 2) had no problem connecting to either my car or my headphones as soon as it noticed they were available. With the Xperia it can be finicky as to if it wants to connect (takes a long time or you have to tell it to connect repeatedly) and frequently likes to have poor quality once it connects. For someone like me who flat out doesn't use the headphone jack having lackluster Bluetooth can be a big time frustration! Other then that it holds charge decently well for that big of a screen."
75629,"I received this package and the battery was not keeping charge, called and explained my issue to a agent after suffering with battery drainage problems for days only to get a replacement which was a used phone. So disappointed. Highly think this is was done on purpose. Left me all furious."
22973,"Purchased and received a refurbished 64Gb galaxy note 5. I was concerned about any defects in the glass or case, but both looked pristine on arrival. Did not receive a SIM tray removal tool which caused me some grief, but holding a sewing needle with a pair of pliers worked fine to pop the tray out. My Note 4 sim card would not fit in the note 5 which really annoyed me. I had to request a new sim from Sprint. Pros: 1) Beautiful screen, seems sharper than the Note 4 in my opinion, even though the specs are the same. 2) 2x2 ac wireless which is working really well with my Asus RT-AC68U. 3) S-Pen and free writing. I like it and use it all the time. 4) Feels very quick and responsive. 5) Built-in wireless charging. Cons: 1) No removable battery. Amost a deal breaker for me, but I decided to buy any way. 2) That pop-out sim tray sucks. Nuf said. 3) Battery life no better than the Note 4. Overall, after using for only 3 days, I'm quite happy with my purchase."
76670,"Great phone, but it will be good if there was a description of what came in the package. * 64 Gb SD Card * Samsung A50 * Earphones * Charger base * Usb C to Usb cable * Silicone case"
13693,"This phone is great for me. I live in California and when I went on vacation to Mexico ,bought a a SIM card from a Telcel store in Puebla even they programed the APN for the phone to work with Telcel. I only paid 100 pesos for The SIM card and 50 pesos for programing. This phone can work with all GSM providers T MOBILE and ATT in USA, Telcel in Mexico. I recommend this phone!"
64493,Be careful when buying. States unlocked phone but phone I recieved was a Sprint phone that Verizon network would not pickup. Spent day trying to figure out with Verizon and sprint with no answer. Will be returning. Looks like a nice phone and will be ordering from someone else. Seller should update description
63202,We tried to activate this phone and it was flagged as stolen. Verizon flagged the account and now were not sure if we can even get our phone number back. Merry freaking Christmas.
7173,"Others must have had no trouble. Does not apply to me. Should have known about buying refurbished. Arrived with a dead battery that would charge but dropped down to 10-20% after 3-4 minutes use. Dead in 5. Had to purchased a new battery. After about 10 days or so it started really acting up. Would change screens without touching it. Talking on the phone would cause it to act like I was punching the screen with my ear. After talking for a few minutes setting were all over the place. (i.e sound was off, bluetooth was on, net was on, etc..) Started to get really warm around the ear mic when talking for more than a few minutes. Decide to return before worse happened."
21787,"The unit was in good cosmetic condition however, would not stay connected to Verizon service, the screen would stay black when restarted and micro SD slot wouldn't read card, piece of crap and waist of my time, I am a Amazon prime member very unhappy"
63510,"Bought two phones. One does not work on the Verizon network, the other's ear speaker was so poor you couldn't hear/understand the person at the other end no matter how much the volume was increased. ""Amazon renewed"" is something new I tried and after losing $80 trying, and failing, to set up service I feel cheated. Just a terrible experience from Amazon. Last phone was purchased through eBay and worked perfectly."
57961,Doesn’t look like new at all. A lot of scratches on screen and the sides. It’s a used phone used by a person with not care (didn’t used a cover or a any kind of screen protection. I’m so disappointed.
24131,This phone is amazing no dents no scratches and charging is amazing and it came with all the correct charging cables and the apple earbud very satisfied.
41953,This phone came in excellent condition and had worked perfectly.
30853,"This was not bad,I paid a good amount for this phone.It works correctly and I haven't had problems.The only thing is that it came totally uncharged"
67056,battery camera speed all things in a very affordable phone
50493,"I fully charged the mobile then shutdown it. After about a week, I could not open the phone, there is no power left!"
20046,"Until I cracked screen, I had insurance and unable to obtain in white..but the short time I had lovely"
59618,Love this phone. Smooth transition. Exceptional pictures.
49837,Remarkable. Ive never had a $150 phone last me this long. Proud owner since its been released and i still have no reasons to upgrade. I'm someone who likes to use their phone like a tool. You use it for everything but i don't need the latest and greatest of gadgets. I just want something that will work out of the box. No funny stuff. And it has served up to that each and every day. What to expect after 2+ years. +Constant updates. Almost monthly. And Android 9!!! * Deffently a beating. I don't use a case on the phone but there is a transparent film to protect the coating. Overall this thing is built like a tank. - The corners are all nicked and even the screen is chipped in the corner. But its still in one piece. No complaints. - The rear camera glass is also chipped. Deffently not goralla glass. - Some light nicks and scuffs on screen. + Charging port is still strong. Cables snap in firm and does not wiggle. - Battery is not as strong as it used to be. Will need to be serviced within a year. Other than some battery issues as of late i have had no reason to need another phone. It just works. The SD430 can be a little sluggish esspecialy on any mainstream app such as Facebook or
33474,"This is a beautiful phone. has a great curve screen and is very fast but it comes with only 16gb of internal storage. the Pre-installed apps and software take about 8 gb of memory so you end up with actually 8gb of free storage. after downloading all my favorites apps, i was left with only 2gb that sooner of later will be used with new apps or games. It has a memory card slot but is pointless because you can't move most of the apps to the sd card. do not buy this phone if you're like me that likes to have a lot of apps and games in your phone, you will end up like me without any storage left for your favorites apps. i will definitely return this phone because of the lack of storage. phones these days should come with at least 32gb."
78775,I just received my i phone i charge it the whole and still 49 percent of battery
31792,Este telefono lo vendieron como desbloqueado. Ahora vot a usarlo y me dice que como la sim no es de verizon no me sirve
69144,I would like to know why did not receive the showed in the 1st photo instead i just received the charger showed in the second photo.
55370,I love the phone..but it had t mobile on it before.. Was hoping that would go away..was like new..pretty great
37130,"This phone is great! However....It turns out the phone that I received is NOT ""US Warranty"". I confirmed the IMEI number with Sony Mobile support, and the phone I received was from Panama. It would also have to be warrantied in Panama. It seemed odd, that the default language was Spanish but I didn't pay attention to that. Ironically, it wasn't until I installed the Amazon app, and it connected me to the Mexican Amazon store, that I realized it. As a bonus, the fingerprint reader works, but I would rather have a valid U.S. 1-year warranty. I have reached out to the seller to see if they will exchange it for me. UPDATE- MARCH 14, 2018 The seller acknowledged that this/my device was from Panama, and offered me 2 options: 1. Return it, for a full refund, plus $8 shipping, and no re-stocking fee, or 2. Keep it, and they would warranty it for 1 year, for manufacturer defects (same as Sony US.) I chose #2, as I already had it setup, and was using it, and didn't want to go through the trouble of replacing it, again. Well done, Mobiles International LLC."
62150,"I bought several of this phone because I had bought Hwawei phone in the past and was satisfied with its performance. Unfortunately, this phone's memory fills up, at least, twice a day. I bought a memory card, but, I find myself struggling to declog the phone's internal memory all the time. It was a waste of my money. Moreover, I'm going to buy different phones for all the folks I gave this phone as present. I'm not known as a guy that buys low quality product. My reputation has been messed up. To add insult upon injury, I kept one of these phones for myself. It fell today on my garage floor. What do you know? The screen shattered! I've used it for less than a month. I'll run from this phone next time. Horrible product."
52540,"Well,i read a lot of reviews before buying this phone for my wife but i must say i was first discouraged because of some reviews i saw but purchased it anyways.i am glad i did because not only the phone was new which i got to know through the serial number,the battery is still 100% and it gives me joy.I will wait for a month of using it before buying another one for my self."
40344,This iPhone 6 just stopped working in two months. Will never but from client again.
51761,Gave this to my sister for her birthday. Wasn't expensive and easy to use
68821,Very good phone with latest features and the battery life is good
22656,I was worried it would be one of those scams. But I'm so glad I got this phone. It arrived almost a week before the projected delivery date and everything has been great and working 100%. Worth the money.
27169,Phone didn't work. Seller is selling defective things
24326,"Just as I had hoped for, great battery life. New screen."
46313,much thanks the delivery was fast and i have no complaints
38505,I love this phone. I've had it for a good while now and I don't have a single complaint.
36043,"Unfortunately my phone when I received it the stylus was stuck in, but everything worked great until the following day when it started not reading my simple card unless I restarted the phone"
16422,This transaction went smoothly. I am satisfied. Thanks
38093,"The best Google phone yet. Coming from the Nexus 6P, I got to say this is a big step up. More ram, much faster cpu/gpu, it's night and day. Battery life is a step up as well. Most pundits call this the best Android phone and for good reason. The screen is excellent as well. Fast battery charge. I sold my 6P for $300 and bought this puppy. Glad I did. My best Android phone yet."
76027,I usually avoid high ticket items as price can cause bias but this thing is amazing. The touch screen is accurate. The photos are beautiful. The gaming is fast. Like stupid fast. The feeling of the screen is like skating on the first ice of the season. The colors are accurate in my opinion. I am a little color blind but I have had no issue so far. The Samsung UI is clean and friendly just like the s8 was. It may be an expensive phone but it is worth the price. Call quality is optimum. My friends sound clear and come through loud even on low settings.
81261,"OK, I'll be totally honest. I don't play games on my phone I typically send text messages, check news & weather, listen to music and yes...make phone calls. The display is gorgeous! even for a 720p OLED display. Fingerprint reader and face unlock work REALLY well, and the audio is incredible when paired with the Anker Soundcore Bluetooth earbuds. I was looking for a replacement for my Apple iPhone 7Plus but in the end, I had to install a different launcher to speed it up and I really missed the wireless pay feature I had. So instead of going back to my iPhone, I ended up returning this one and getting a Samsung A70 (bigger, higher-res display & google pay). If you're looking for a really good budget phone and you don't play games, then you found it! I'd also recommend the SunRemex Carbon Fiber Designed Galaxy A20 Case for this phone. It's so good I purchased the same case for my Samsung A70."
20130,Battery will not charge. It’s been plugged in for about an hour and won’t move past the red dead-battery symbol.
17804,"It's a big garbage, the phone I received is super used, I do not recommend it at all, 💯 loss of money"
75913,"The camera quality blew my mind , and so bright, worth every penny."
79778,I used to be a iPhone fanboy but I I have learned to love this phone. Hands down it is the best phone I have ever used in the picture quality particularly at night is amazing. I recommend this phone to everyone.
42088,Just as advertised. A great phone for a great price in great condition
65488,"Replacement phone till my upgrade is available. Works great, and looks good."
70312,"I have purchased this phone as soon as it became available, i had a feeling it would be a great phone, and OH MY GOD it is! I have had many phones in the last 10 years and this is BY FAR my favorite phone in the last 3-4 years. I was always a Nokia user before the whole smartphone revolution and could not wait to get back to using their product again. I am surprised this phone is priced like this, I would gladly pay twice the price. Screen is great, build quality is outstanding, it looks and feels premium, love the pure Android One experience. I hope Nokia continues making their new devices as great as this one. Thank you!"
3198,"In one sentence, all I can say about this phone is that its the best cheap smartphone hands down. PROS: - Great battery life. You should have at least 50% on normal usage after one day. - 4G LTE - Small form factor, with a big screen - High quality build. The kevlar is great, and the metal siding is also very strong. There is plastic, glossy material on the camera area, but surprisingly after a month, there isn't even a scratch (no case on it too!). - Micro SD Card adds up to 32GB storage - Decent screen. Not HD like the other Razrs, but the vibrancy of the color balances out the slight pixelation you see. - Quick settings menu. A great addition to the standard Ice Cream Sandwich 4.0.4 - Will be upgraded to Jelly Bean 4.2 in less than 2 months. Promised by Google to be upgraded before the year ends. - Speaker is pretty good - Circles widget. Probably my favorite widget all time, and only the new Motorola phones have it - Great home screen. You start with only one page instead of five, which I find much better. I only have two pages on mine. - Google Now coming soon - Fast Snapdragon S4 processor. Same one as the Samsung Galaxy S III's - It's a phone that actually looks different than all the others. I don't know of any other phone that looks like this. - Big screen at 4.3"". Not a huge screen, but its better than the iPhone 5's 4"". - On screen buttons. I found the hardware buttons frustrating since I would hit them by accident. Glad they moved away from them! And these on screen buttons disappear while watching videos/movies. - Great call quality - Smart Actions CONS: - Occasional lag, but it doesn't get in the way of what you're doing - Once in awhile the data won't come on in low connection areas, while they do on other phones - Camera isn't great. In the dark, the pictures come out weird. My original Razr took better pictures than my Razr M. Overall, its a great phone and I would highly recommend to anyone that doesn't want to spend $200-$300 on a phone!"
54453,"OK I'm a smartphone newbie. I was perfectly happy with my old flip phone until I had to start texting several times a day and texting on the flip phone was just tough. So I started my smartphone quest, knowing that I was going to be a difficult customer to please. It took me 4 attempts...tried a Apple iPhone, a Blackberry, a Blu and this Nokia. This Nokia easily worked best for me...easy to use, great battery life and affordable. I like it so much that I don't think I'll upgrade it until I'm forced to."
23349,I love it! Phone is in better condition than describe!
31789,I have had the phone for only about a month but I haven't had any problems. No scratches no technical problems...I am extremely pleased with my purchase.
74216,"The phone I received had multiple issues. The phone would get too hot in a short period of time, even though I'm not gaming or using high-end apps. There was also a spot of the screen where it would act on its own so it was very difficult to use. The phone looks nice and the camera is good for the price, but the issues I had with it made me want to return it."
7253,Big beatiful Great my s5 friends make fun of it because they are jelous they wish they had a mega
3762,I just brought this phone 2 months ago and it turn off and wouldn't come back on. So upset!!
9133,Both Amazon and Green Squared have been terrific. Ordered two phones and only got one but they were all on it immediately and e-mailed right away. Will keep dealing with Amazon and its vendors!!!!
72436,Better than what I had expected. I’m definitely hooked.
38862,"I have had this phone for about 80 days now and I just cannot deal with it anymore so I am returning it and buying the Moto G7. I am having to charge it 3-4 times a day with normal use. I get about 2 hours of screen on time per charge. I have left the phone overnight at 60% and woke up to it being dead. Also these phones are very slow and modern apps do not run well on it. Save your money and buy a NEW phone - not refurbished especially since Amazon doesn't refurbish the batteries which is the biggest issue. Just don't buy it. There are many things that are fine buying refurbished, but a 4 year old phone is not one of them."
70949,"This was a good phone. Got stolen visiting another country, it attracted pick pockets"
64626,"Looked brand-new, and performs like it, too. Only complaint is the charger included isn't a fast charger, but I already had a couple of those lying around anyway. I was going to get a Pixel 3a but this was cheaper and a lot better."
39648,Don't do it. Back camera box screen broke after 1 mo. Screen several months later. Phone stopped being able to update either through 4g or manually with a computer. Phone randomly reboots. Cracks all over front and back now. This is the phone that finally drove me off Samsung. Nope.
1255,"well, i can say that your product is so great and for me is working exelent ,have a very usseful aplications and wonderfull software..."
49238,The Sony Xperia phone was not in the box delivered to me. A flash for picture camera instead was found in the the box delivered ti me with my name on it.
14100,Very nice phone. Works as advertised. The person using it is a newbie to smart phones and very basic with pc's in general so this is like the future! :-)
21579,"It told me I was buying a 16GB phone and it only has 11GB, need to look closer to the product, but all in al it is amazing. Not a single issue."
63715,Not recomended!! Í ordered dual SIM phone and received single SIM
18396,"Phone is okay but will not stop going through ""Hands free activation"" upon every power up which just cycles the phone on and off to no end unless you force stop it with very little time given. I feel like I should have returned it for this reason but I don't have the time to. Wish they weren't deceptive and would have just been up front about the issue."
81599,"Why would you buy this thing when there are sooo many better options out there for half the price. All the marketing effort Google is throwing at this legacy hardware is starting to look like apple, and it is sad."
12177,This phone was not able to be activated. Was returned for refund
6902,I like it a lot and my wife is happy with it. Didn't have the chance to test it a lot since I'm not the user but the look and feel of the phone for me is much better than most of the other brands and the responsiveness is great. I also like the screen definition and colors.
62301,"More than a bit disappointing that the battery life of the 6th gen Moto G (I've owned 4 of the previous 5 generations) doesn't measure up to it's forebearers. Lenovo says it's an all-day battery, but I have not found that to be the case. Find myself charging it in the middle of the day sometimes. I often bring along my fifth gen unit when I go out for the entire day just so I'll be sure to have a working phone in the late afternoon. Other than that it's an excellent phone and camera for the money. Battery life is the only issue."
47573,"This Samsung device receives 9.5 from me. I have had an issue with almost every apple iPhone, mostly because of their weak cell receptions. I was always frustrated with call quality and apps crashing. Also with the last IPhone 6S I had owned the battery would always drain once down to around 25%. This S8+ does not have any of those problems and is phenomenal in performance. There is no slowdown switching from apps, video and call quality are top notch. Color calibration to app resolution, video games to Microsoft apps, whatever you throw at it, it does without difficulty. Call quality, audio and cell reception quite excellent. I have T Mobile service and was worrying that the speed would drop from LTE down to 4G or 3. Not once does it drop from LTE speeds. I know many people complain about the 16:9 ratio. This doesn't bother me. If you want to use pictures for desktop, just adjust the ratio in Camera app. Almost every app is now fitted for the screen ratio and when streaming videos, you can double tap the screen to zoom to fit. This feature makes the video streaming very very enjoyable. The only complain I have is with the AKG ear phones the phone comes with. Ear buds do not have a good bass. I ended up using the Samsung ear buds instead. Factory Unlocked version is definitely worth the price because there are no Carrier bloatware on it. Yes! No more Bloatware."
46900,"Phone showed up packaged and ready to go. I was and still am pleased with my purchase. Happiness wise it's not what I was hoping for. The transceiver is busted so I can't connect to the network and the battery drains like a sieve. Even with background data restricted, battery saver on and not using mobile data, I barely get a fulls day charge."
72670,"Should have chosen the 8plus but the S8 is awesome , had a little hiccup but my tech guy got it all squared off. I am enjoying my phone alot."
11346,My Mom left her old one outside in the rain and it wouldn't work after it got wet. The new one works just like the old one.
52154,Still a lot to learn on about the features but it does all the things I need and it has a killer battery that lasts a very long time.
71202,I wonder if I'm just unlucky or if the high reviews were largely paid for. I will never buy this brand again.
77076,I have purchased two of these phones in last 6 weeks. The Good: Battery life is phenomenal - lasts full 2 days. The Bad: Terrible on phone calls. It is a phone and it cannot do its basic function. Takes forever for a call to connect IF it even connects. People receiving calls cannot understand you. Voice mail left is garbled. The really BAD: Screen protrudes out past cover leading to cracked screen. Had phone only a few weeks before screen cracked. Skip model itdoes not perorm well.
19392,"I bought this as a replacement. It is a sturdy, reliable phone without all the fancy extras. Unfortunately, after less than 60 days, it quit working. I had to buy a replacement phone immediately, because I could not be without a phone."
13749,"I am very disappointed with the Samsung s5 g900v it keep shutting off each time I make or receive a call, I can not receive picture text ,sometime I don't get WiFi on the road"
27616,iPhone was a Birthday present for my daughter. She cried when she opened it. Looked perfect. Exactly what she wanted
27051,"Sorry I was wrong....this product is not deserve a STAR. You can not connect this phone to T-Mobile net work at all. It doesn't matter if you use instruction( provided in a box), this phone do not want to connect to T-Mobile net work. I need to file for full refund. Do not buy this product."
27391,Worst experience ever! I purchased this phone & I can't activate it because the previous owner has a past due balance!!!
58107,I got my phone two day before it was supposed to be delivered no scratches perfect working condition came with a glass screen protector as well above and beyond what I was expecting
75484,"While in general the phone is very nice, I was extremely disappointed to realize that it does not support wifi calling, which I was counting on having. The fingerprint recognition seems pretty worthless. It worked a couple of times but usually says to press harder and then stops working at all. I haven't had it long enough to really to rate it on battery life. I feel that the lack of wifi calling should be prominently mentioned in the description."
36554,"The phone has some scratches on the corners but the screen was perfect. Also, I was able to use my Verizon SIM card and it works perfectly on the network. Love having a small phone again!"
14423,"this is a Nexus, don't let the name fool you. Motorola made their bloody masterpieces in 2014: the Moto X and the Droid Turbo. The X14 is amazing.. just make sure you get the 32 gigabyte version.. the 16 comes with 10 useable gigs =("
51973,Unlock the bootloader and enjoy the amazing radio that works on any network and the battery that lasts for days. You really can't beat the value.
64976,Does not work with virgin mobil. I changed to att prepay and it works
73140,phone said used verygood man this phone look new im happy with my purchase so far will update if problems seems great so far.
60037,This was a great purchase. The phones are beautiful and in perfect condition.
72225,Muy buen equipo a un precio accesible. Muy buena presentación
67990,The item online says it was supposed to be new when we receive the item it was not new because it had text messages saved from December of 2018.
59942,BEWARE! It says it’s Verizon but when you turn it on it says it’s T-Mobile. Had to return it.
11559,"There may be something wrong with the charger plug-in on the phone. I have to wiggle it to make the charging indicator (simulated battery on the phone) work. If I don't wiggle it, the charging indicator (simulated battery on the phone) will stick on one of the four white ""charging"" lines on the indicator. While realizing there was a 14 day guarantee, Bonanza Deals SHOULD have made SURE the phone was 100% good to go by testing everything before they advertised it. I have an extended warantee with Verizon for an additional $3 / month. If the phone poops out, I'll get a new one from Verizon."
22491,"I got the Grey Samsung Galaxy S6 Active as a replacement (via AT&T) for my old Samsung Galaxy S4 Active, which had a cracked screen. I was so disappointed with it that I returned the Samsung Galaxy S6 Active and had my old Samsung Galaxy S4 Active repaired instead. The Samsung Galaxy S6 Active has a high resolution clear screen, it is thin and lightweight for its size, and it is fast, and it charges fast and the battery lasts longer. That’s all good. However, two of the three features that I valued the most in my Samsung Galaxy S4 Active have been removed. First the replaceable battery: The replaceable battery in my Samsung Galaxy S4 Active made it possible for me to never have to wait for my phone to charge. I just switched out the battery when it was empty. Replacing the battery took 5 seconds. The backup battery/batteries I could charge any time and I did not need to be present and wait for it. I just carried the extra battery/batteries in my pocket or briefcase. Since I have gotten used to not charging phones I found the Samsung Galaxy S6 Active to be very inconvenient. With a Samsung Galaxy S6 Active I had to change how I went about my day. In addition, if the battery failed I could just replace it on the S4 (again five seconds). If this would happen on this phone I would have to send it away for repairs. It hasn’t happen to me but it would be another big inconvenience if it would happen. Secondly the Samsung Galaxy S6 Active does not have a replaceable SD memory card. I take quite a bit of pictures and some of them are business related and somewhat confidential and not something I would put on the “cloud”. The third feature that I valued highly is the ruggedness and water resistant feature. I just have to trust it is still there based on the testing done. However, two out of three gone was too much for me, which is why I returned it. It seems to be that Samsung is trying to attract the iPhone crowd and are ignoring their old loyal fan base and why they loved the Samsung Galaxy in the first place."
68092,Phone works great. No issues. Would recommend this phone to anyone.
43146,"If anything, I was expecting the programs to work but there'd be some cosmetic issues. It has been the complete opposite. Whenever the gallery or camera apps are opened, even for a second, the entire phone freezes and restarts on its own. The company has agreed to take the phone back and supply me a new one, but now I am dealing with the hassle of being without a phone again for whatever amount of time."
37955,"Just switched to the Google Fi network and got this phone; I love both, the network and the phone! Made for Google, the way Google intended it to be. People are annoyed because it looks too much like a iPhone, but frankly that doesn't bother me. Pros: The configuration is fast! Google Assistant is awesome. Great resolution Awesome camera (both rear and front) which takes sharp pictures in dim light Unlimited space on Google photos! 3 months unlimited subscription to Google Music My battery lasts almost 2 days with moderate use. Upon restarting, it does not allow you to use the fingerprint scanner (that makes it more secure) Cons: They took out the ""Driving Mode"" (you can download the app Drivemode though) No active display with notifications that fade in and out (there's an app for that as well) Can't ""find my phone"" with voice activation like my old Motorola phone could. Too many messaging programs -- Hangouts, Messenger Allo... ! Geez Google. Still, it's an awesome phone and I have not had any issues with it."
43736,"After receiving my phone, it immediately showed faulty issues do to a bad motherboard. I notified them, sent it back and got a new phone and this one was incompatible and could not activate. Wasted a whole month without a phone to go through all this trouble and nearly missed the deadline to be able to return it for a refund. Save yourselves the trouble and do not buy from here"
51533,"Looks and functions great, but the battery life is lacking"
46283,"This is, by far, the worst smart phone I've owned (almost ten, second Samsung). Its blutooth pairing is completely unreliable and --worst of all-- its interface is incredibly slow and unresponsive. I touch the screen and nothing happens: is it because the app is bogged down or did the phone not register the touch? WAIT AND SEE! I know it's the phone because I have the exact same experience with the two bottom touch buttons and with the only physical press-down button. My normal experience is a 2-5 second delay responding to a major action like launching, closing, or switching between an app. Apps that worked just fine on my last two phones now crash or freeze. Once in a while the phone notices the app is not responding but, more often I'm the one that has to notice and take action, which segues nicely into my next complaint. I have to reboot this phone constantly. Phone stops responding in an app and won't close/switch apps? REBOOT. Phone experiences network blip? REBOOT. Phone can't talk to an already-paired blutooth device? REBOOT. Phone can't detect a new blutooth device? REBOOT. Phone is on? REBOOT. It's like a Windows computer from before, uh, well, probably still. The pre-loaded ROM has annoying problems but someone who likes the phone could fix that with minimal effort so I'm not getting into them beyond noting they exist. It gets two stars because it turns on and performs basic functions, however poorly. I'm considering it a bad mistake and am looking into replacing it and just eating the purchase price. Yes, it's that bad. I like to donate old phones to Cell Phones for Soldiers, but donating this would seem like a bad prank. I will probably go Office Space on it when I pick a replacement. PC LOAD LETTER THIS, SAMSUNG. I should note, for context, my favorite smart phone was a Samsung. No other phone has matched it. I also have both this piece of garbage and an iPhone 7plus, which I don't like but works so well it makes this phone's faults that much more apparent."
26741,"This phone fell out of my pocket on a rollercoaster, with no case on it, and it is completely fine. There is a dent in the top near the headphone jack, but it still works with headphones. I couldn't recommend it more to the accident-prone."
69879,"Yes! The best Android product. One of the best computing devices I have ever seen in 40+ years of computing engineering. Of course there are some compromises in its construction. Any & every product is the sum of its compromises. None of these compromises affects its function to any degree. The most ""glaring"" (read obvious) compromise is screen size. I would like it to be 12"" (30cm) in size, 😏 Second compromise? Battery should have 200A/Hr instead of 4A/Hr. Both these features will exclude it from fitting in any human pocket. So there... 😀 Software? Very good [for what Android can hope to be]. Support is excellent."
10404,"Great phone, but I definitely recommend buying a tough outer case for it. I am pretty clumsy and my phone has been saved quite a few times by my Otterbox."
15578,The phone shuts itself off all by itself over and over.
24997,"The phone works great, the battery lasts me through the day, sometimes two with moderately low usage. OS is fast to work with, and nothing bogging me down. This is a second OnePlus 2 I've purchased to be given to someone else and I've never had a problem with either of them."
81201,I like this phone very much I'm very satisfy. Thanks.
9611,Great product. Haven't found a problem with it yet.
32156,Does not include the key to open the SIM/SD slot - totally unusable without!
76042,"I absolutely love the Galaxy S10! Only thing I wished was that it had a 5000 mah battery because battery life is okay. It's not bad but definitely could be improved. Power users will want to carry a external battery with them in order to use this phone at maximum potential ie having the screen bright, keeping it running at high performance without using power saving functions. Plus it comes with a screen protector. It's not the best one but I love that it came with one."
39644,I purchased this phone to use with StraightTalk on the Verizon network and it has been a BIG disappoint. It seems as if the service area has decreased. When making a call the PHONE drops the data rate to 1G. So no lookin up any information during a phone call unless you are on wifi. I had freaking dropped calls in 2017! I've had an HTC on ST on Verizon and it was way better than this phone. Well I guess I'll be getting a new phone for Christmas.
35729,"The cellphone is amazing, it was shipped and delivered quickly. Mine is the US version unlocked (SM-G935U) and it works excellent with Metro PCS. Mine has warranty until September next year. You can check that with your imei when you get the phone on info.imei But... The phone didn't come with the Sim extraction tool, and the packaging was very bad, just a big cardboard box with another cardboard box and the phone inside, the should of put some air bags or something for couchon. Anyway the phone is in great condition and it hasn't given me problems so far. My phone came with the Samsung earphones, quick charger and cable. I truly recommend to get the phone a case. I got one from spigen, you should check it out, they do very nice cases."
39305,"This product is exactly what I expected. It has several minor scratches and the battery life is very slightly shorter than a new phone, but (so far at least) it runs fine and has fine battery life. It seems comparable to my old phone, which I broke by dropping it (hence the need for a replacement). I am not sure that I would buy this as a new phone, but as a replacement for a used phone at a reasonable price it does just fine."
76235,"Design, battery, screen. I do not take many selfies at all so this phone is absolutely brilliant for me. Must have."
61129,Like new! Original fast charger would've been a plus.
6608,"The touchless control is very helpful; when I pick up my phone, it can magically wake up; the battery capacity is acceptable (I am a heavy user, and the battery life can still last half a day)."
20382,Good IPhone 6 plus in Gold i had no problem yet whit the phone i recommend this sellers thank you very much😁 went i open thet box i wast Nervers but went i saw the phone i say wow this is new thank you i hope days and months pass i hope it stay like this working good👍keep up the good work
60184,"I just wish I've switched to Huawei Mate 10 Pro earlier. Performance, AI technology, quality build, HDR10 support, 4000mhA battery that optimized by AI so by the end of the day your battery is at 90+%, Leica professional camera, KIRIN 970 processor with AI that is constantly optimized based on your usage, 128 GB internal memory, 6GB RAM, super fast charging (30 min = 60%), EMUI 8.0 skin features on top of Android 8.0, instant desktop mode without docking station just need $20 USB C to HDMI cable, beautiful design, stereo speakers, price < $600, the list of pros just goes on and on. If this is not a perfect flagship phone, then I don't know what is the definition of a perfect phone anymore. Do yourself a favor, YouTube Huawei Mate 10 Pro features, tips and tricks, understand all of the them, then just buy it, you'll understand why this phone was blocked from making a splash on US market. It would've created tsunami effect :-)."
2514,Did everything it was advertised to do. Good little phone
70714,"I bought this phone from amazon not sure of what I was gonna receive, but I was shocked to get almost like a brand new phone l, no scratches no nothing, the battery life is 100%, love my new phone, thanks guys for keeping it cool."
37584,"Compared to not having a phone this is great. We're not talking about something dramatically important. However, compared to every other phone on the market, this device is terrible. I cannot think of one thing it does superior to any other phone on the market. From its camera to its ads and bloatware to its general compatibility with other devices. This is a terrible phone. Because I spent so much on it I've also spent lots of time trying to convince myself that it's all right. But it is not all right and I'm going to give mine away and buy something else at. It's not even good as just a phone. You can't hear the ringer and you can't hear text notifications. Go ahead and buy it and you will quickly find out. To most of its problems there are no Solutions or workarounds."
78383,"amazinggg , everything works fine , it should've came with headphones but other than that it's awesome & great for the price"
35590,"This is without a single doubt, the best smart phone on the market. I have played with the LG G5 and the HTC 10, and I can tell you neither are in the class of the S7, and especially not the S7 Edge Exynos version. The Exynos version has better battery life than the Snapdragon 820 version, and it does a much, much, much better job with power and memory management. The white one is my favorite, and I had to look high and low to find one. But I have it now, and it's very cool to have what almost nobody else has. Great phone! It's stylish, well built, beautifully sculpted with the best screen in the industry. Even touchwiz is light, fast and smooth. This phone has ZERO lag. Everything's better on the Edge. And don't let people tell you that the edge feature is gimmicky. It is EXACTLY what you make it. If you don't spend a minute learning what it can do, it will do little for you. But, if you decide to learn all of its features, and employ them fully, this feature can be one of the best on the device. I also didn't find it useful at first, because I allowed all of the reviewers to influence me that it is just a gimmick. But then I watched a review where the guy really laid out what it could actually do, and decided to look into it further. In the end, I have found it to be a vital part of my functions on this phone. So if you are part of the ""too lazy to discover"" generation, then you might not find it useful. But if you want to get all you can out of this device, it can become vital. One last thing, get a case for this phone immediately. The biggest drawback of this device is that if you break it, the waterproofing is gone, even after repair."
9277,Very good to use only simply calling and receiving. Only one concern is the back cover easily to slip out.
33083,"Delivery took two business days. I chose this phone because of it's gorgeous design. Blending a seamless edge to edge display, thin body width, and small screen ratio this phone is definitely unique. (I hope to see more modern phones trending towards smaller ergonomically friendly designs just because not everyone has mammoth hands)! The battery life isn't the greatest but honestly I don't mind getting a wireless charger. In the end I am willing to sacrifice poor battery life for incredible style. -Expected update to nougat 7.0 sometime in 2017."
570,"I bought this as an emergency phone for my mom, who has a tendency to leave her cell behind (at work, at a relative's house, etc) and no longer has a land line. As such, I expect she will use the phone for a few days every couple of months. The payment plans available are extremely unfriendly for this purpose. All of the available plans are ""use it or lose it"" - minimum deposit is $15 monthly or $25 that expires in 3 months. When the billing period is up, AT&T eats all your unspent funds and you have to pump more into the account in order to use the phone again. There is NO option for people who want to pay only for time used. I suppose I shouldn't be surprised by this, but the ATT reps are apparently coached to be dishonest when setting up the plans as well. I asked the rep I spoke with at least 3 times if there were any hidden fees or monthly minimums, and she said ""no"" three times. After making an additional deposit I get on the web site and learn about the ""expiration date"" on money deposited. If you were planning to use this phone as a backup, plan to spend at least $100 a year in fees just to keep the phone accessible for emergency use."
46615,Rooted Phone according to Samsung. Samsung Pay did not work because of that fact. Returned. Found another and it all works.
39500,"Great product my wife love this phone, she was so excited to get it"
75319,Great product. I had Samsung before replacing it with this Sony. Once you go Sony you will never go back. I wanted something larger to watch videos on a higher resolution and larger screen. This powerhouse has delivered. It is now compatable with Verizon which made this an unbeatable deal. If you use on Verizon network you have to call them and instruct them to make your Sim card CDMAless.
62032,Great phone!!! Long life battery. Beautiful design. Very good purchase. Love the camera
18982,Very happy with this product. I got an external batery. So no fuss with the issue
22289,"The hardware packed in this thing is incredible. I'll do my quick list of pros and cons first to get those out of the way. Pros: Big, bright screen Fast Durable Amazing camera quality Loud speakers Fast charging Cons: No expandable storage Button placement is quirky (personal opinion) Only on AT&T Okay, now to expand on some of my thoughts. Coming from a Nokia Lumia 920 Windows Phone to this, 3 years later, is a wonderfully welcome experience. I never thought I would have such a fast and fluid device in my hands. The incredible screen resolution gives such a crisp, clear viewing experience. I thought it was nice on my old 1280 x 712 display... Wow. I am blown away. The device is fast. I've never felt it lag or slow down. I've played a few games and it keeps up 100%. It's a dream. On top of that, the phone feels very durable. The housing is rugged and feels like it'll really withstand a lot of drops and whatnot. I didn't get to play with the phone before ordering, so I assumed the Active's housing would make the phone significantly heavier, but no. The thing is lighter than my smaller Nokia phone. Now the camera... I am a semi-professional photographer with a few DSLR cameras. I know what good image quality really is and have a great idea of what to compare images to. I can say with confidence that the rear camera on this phone will definitely impress. Coming from the 8MP camera on the Nokia, this thing delivers superb image quality and color accuracy. I love it. I use instagram quite a lot for a lot of my behind the scenes images with my work, and this camera has really bumped up the quality of posts. The front facing camera is the best I've ever seen too. No more pixelation in video calls or ""selfies"". Love it. The speakers on this phone are nice and loud. The maximum volume setting doesn't degrade sound quality either. I play a lot of music through my phone and this system takes the cake. Easily twice as loud as my Nokia 920. Fast charging is a beautiful thing. From 25%, my phone charged to 100% in less than an hour. Wow. I couldn't even imagine going back now. On that note, the huge 3500m battery is awesome. From 100% in the morning, my phone lasts all day with a good portion leftover in the evening. I do a lot of browsing and some game playing throughout the day and to not have to worry about my phone dying by 5pm is amazing. By the time I hit the bed, it's still got 20-30% left in the tank."
15302,"When the item arrived, it was functional. At low brightness 90% of the screen flickers in green, which I suspect is related to a previous owner's water damage. The screen also has the previous home menu burnt into it (similar to CRT monitors) The part that frustrates me the most is there seems to be some unwanted software baked into it that MalwareBytes is unable to detect and/or remove. The software in question opens up seemingly-random pages in the Samsung Internet Browser, and would open even when using other programs. This is avoided by denying all permissions and turning on power saving mode to prevent the browser from having any ability to open without explicitly being clicked and installing a different browser."
62440,"Charging the battery of Motorola g6 play from 0 to 100 percent takes too long, more than three hours and this can give you 12 to 24 hours of use. If the phone is on idle mode the battery can last up to 42 hours. All other features of the phone are okay."
59349,"The Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra Phone is a great new smartphone just released by Sony. It is factory unlocked. It is a rather large phone with an impressive HD 1080p 6"" edge to edge display screen covered with Gorilla Glass. It does make itself known as it weighs in at 7.8 ounces. It has three cameras, two front-facing cameras, one of which takes 120 degree super wide photos. Yea for the selfies! The main camera is rear-facing and takes all the usual photos and can make regular and slow-motion video recordings. It has excellent audio quality. It comes equipped with a large capacity battery that just seems to let the phone's charges last and last. It has a Qualcomm Snapdragon 630 processor platform, and its operating system is an Android Oreo 8.0. It has a fully functioning fingerprint sensor to unlock the phone. The list of goodies seems endless. I am coming off a dinosaur of a cell phone and this new model Sony Experia has really impressed me with its capabilities. I am slowing working my way through what it can do to make my life easier. I have been very pleased with the results so far and frankly, I expect to be able to launch a rocket to Mars soon. Well, maybe just to the Moon. I know that I have a lot to learn to reap the full benefits of this terrific device and it is a pleasure discovering each new task made easier while using it."
27813,It works okay . It freezes sometimes though and sometimes the audio from songs or apps still go on even when you get out of the app . But other than that everything is fine
17532,This phone is great especially for the price its a great charge for long time and if ur someone who had a Windows phone this thing will open so many doors let me tell you.
41382,Edge cellular sent me a faulty charge cord and headphones that do not work.
65512,El teléfono viene bloqueado por AT&T si no tienes ese operador no funciona.
29083,Sprint added a sim card and got it up and running for no charge at all. Very impressed with this phone.
18468,Phone shut off & will not cut on. WHAT A RIP OFF....
67543,I was a little hesitant on an unfamiliar brand name but so far could not be more pleased. I was a little worried about the lack of LTE capability but that is well compensated by big RAM and really fast processor. Sleek appearance and comfortable feel make it a pleasure to use and screen is huge with outstanding picture quality. Sound quality on calls is outstanding. Android 9 is beautiful as are the updates to Google services. Printed instructions are lackiing but much can be found on the phone itself. Still I had to go to the Metro store to complete set-up. Not a big deal.
950,"wife is very happy with it...all she wanted in a phone was one simple to use for all she does is call and or text on it, so the ""dumb"" phone works for what she wants/needs it for!"
53428,"So I'm the kind of person who doesn't mind buying technology that's a couple of years old, i.e., I don't need the latest gadgets. And I can save a lot of money that way, especially when it comes to cell phones. I had purchased a Motorola Droid Turbo 2 a couple of years ago, my second Android phone (I've given up on the overpriced iPhones). The DT2 was a nice upgrade from my previous Android, a Samsung Galaxy Mini S4, with a better camera. Unfortunately, that DT2 phone didn't last too long. Started having problems with the battery draining too fast, and I got the vertical green lines that seems to plague some DT2 phones. However, I really liked the phone and was seriously thinking of buying another DT2 to replace it. I took a look at some of the other Motorola models out there, though (I like Motorola because of the Moto Actions that allow you to turn on the flashlight or the camera with a flick of the wrist, without having to unlock or turn on the screen), and found the Moto X4. Since it was less than $150, I decided to give it a try, and I'm very glad I did. Switching over the phone to my existing carrier was easy, all I had to do was move the SIM card and the 32GB memory card from my DT2 over to the new phone and I was up and running right away, didn't even have to go into Verizon. The Moto X4 is much better than the DT2, with longer battery life and a better camera. I can go a whole day on a single charge. If I charge it up to 100% before I go to bed, it's still at 96% by the time I get up the next morning. And the operating system upgrades itself, i.e., it started off with Oreo (8.0), but over the course of several days, it began installing upgrades until it's now at Pie (9.0), and all of the monthly security updates are loaded. One feature I really like is the fingerprint sensor. It is so easy, now, to unlock my phone, especially since I use my phone for work and my company requires strong security options to be selected, like long passwords. With the DT2, I had to enter an eight character password every time I wanted to unlock the screen, a real PITA. I had to also enter a PIN every time I opened up Outlook or Skype. On the Moto X4, I just press my finger or thumb on the fingerprint sensor and it opens up right away. No more entering passwords for either my phone or my apps (for the ones that support fingerprint authorization instead of a password or PIN). Even the Starbucks app allows me to use my fingerprint instead of typing a password. One thing that still trips me up is that the power and volume control buttons are backwards from the DT2, i.e., on the DT2, the power button is on top with the volume controls below it. On the Moto X4, the volume buttons are at the top and the power button below. So I find myself turning up the volume a lot of times instead of turning off the phone. The Moto X4 uses a USB-C cable instead of the more ubiquitous USB mini plug. The phone does come with a USB-C cable, but I ended up buying several extra so I would have one in my car, my bedroom, my backpack, etc. I also bought an extra charging block, and you want to make sure you buy one that supports Quick Charge 2 or 3 if you want to take advantage of the TurboPower feature (I got the Anker Quick Charge 3.0 unit). Probably the one thing I miss from the DT2 is the wireless charging. I wish Motorola would make that feature available on more of their models."
41184,Defective product. Certified refurbished means absolutely nothing to this company. Avoid them if possible.
78722,I bought this iPhone and it was the only one left in stock so I was concerned but it is in amazing And no scratches no marks no dents it was absolutely perfect I am super happy with this and will definitely buy from this vendor again
56907,"UPDATE: I had to order from a different seller who even did same day delivery, the first seller sent me an international version that was locked, but the new one was US version and unlocked. Super easy to switch from iPhone to this device and its amazing! UPDATE: I just spoke with Samsung support, they cannot do anything to help unlock the phone because it IS NOT US VERSION it is a dual SIM card international version. Now I am trying to contact Amazon and the seller to try and remedy this situation. I was super excited to get this device and when I got home from work to set it up, I couldn’t even get to the home screen because of Factory Reset Protection being enabled. Now I have a very expensive brick until I can get this resolved. Will update as the situation changes."
16384,"What I don't like about it, is that the information about the phone being unlocked was false advertising."
44795,"I bought a new sony Xperia XA1,but it didn’t have the headphones,I don’t know why,I tried to call the seller but there’s no phone number to contact him."
9827,"My phone was all dinged up and restarted itself randomly as soon as I got it. Now it does it so often that I can't get anything done on the phone. I contacted the seller but he responded with ""returns period has expired"", so I am left with a defective phone."
75045,"Great phone, great deal, but Keep Your Box and everything that came with it. At first it didn't connect to the network, then after a reset, it did, I made some calls, worked fine. Until people tried to call me. It would ring but there was nothing on the screen prompting me to answer. My advice: Use it thoroughly for a week or two, make sure everything works well, incoming calls, outgoing calls, texts, internet... If I cannot answer phone calls I will have to return this and buy a phone at a local store."
35173,"Didn't work. When turned on, it started vibrating and would not stop. It locked up and vibrated until powered down. Over and Over."
34323,Best fro the rest. Amazin. Using it as my second phone.
38030,"The Pixel is a beautiful phone: great display, gorgeous camera, wonderful connection to the google ecosystem. What you need to know, though, is that it is INCREDIBLY fragile and there is not a lot of great support to back up your purchase of this product. One time I forgot my phone was in my back pocket when I went in the bathroom. The phone ended up in the toilet for 5 seconds. Not even a month old and it is completely dead. We tried all the traditional tactics: rice, dehydrator, opening it up to clean corrosion, sending it away to google's contracted support company (uBreakiFix), and no one can get any life out of this phone again. Everyone shrugs and says, ""tough break"" when I ask for some help. Only buy this phone if you are sure it's never going to accidentally get dropped or end up in or near water as it seems to be way more susceptible to these common mishaps than the iPhone or other androids. Such a bummer because it was a really nice phone."
30823,If this is refurbished then it is a joke. Now it is going to cost me an additional $80 to get the battery replaced.
70744,When I put on the speaker the other person couldn't hear me.
319,"no one could program it so sent t back, case was a waste. was with out a phone for 10 days."
74224,"No recibí un teléfono, me mandaron una manguera con unos tornillos."
27668,Did not like the set up process. Liked the picture quality.
12127,"Get rid of the Motorola android because of battery swelling all the time. You think they would have an app to stop the charging at 100%. since I have to buy batteries all the time, I might as well get a phone that the battery doesn't swell up."
19596,This phone is the worst cell phone you could ever buy. I have never seen anything so cumbersome to try and send a text on. Very poorly designed for texting.
68946,"Love it, nice camera and the size is pretty big like iPhone XS plus"
77275,"An international G7 Power version used in the USA: I was quite concerned about buying the Intl version instead of the USA version, but the advantages for a few $$ more for the Intl were just too overwhelming, especially 64 gigs instead of 32 gigs internal memory, 4 gigs RAM instead of 3, and dual SIM capability. Seems to have all the present bands and channels (except 71. I'm on T-Mobile in San Antonio TX and use it in France, and the USA domestically. Absolutely mo negatives after six weeks. A clear, sharp, bright screen at 50% brightness. Almost impossible to notice any difference between this phone and my two other AMOLED screened phones. No edge light leakage, has good color, sharp, etc. After 3 full days use I usually have around 30+/-% battery left (amazing). All actions fast with no lag anywhere. Speaker is really loud and clear. Moto FM Radio app is excellent. Charging is Turbofast as advertised and cool charging and with use. Comes with nice, flexible non-slip, clear, plastic case. Instructions were in Spanish but I used Google Translate app to easily translate. Construction appears excellent and sturdy. 5000 battery hardly increases phone thickness. The fingerprint sensor is flawless and fast. Camera: Photography is important to me. The camera does not have all the fancy, complicated, expensive features of the high-end, flagship-$$$ phones; however, it simply works fine, has adequate settings, adjustments, options to take good pictures day and night. And Google Photos or Snapseed app can spiff things up if really needed, although I have not needed to do that -- yet. Good colors, exposure, focusing, stabilized video, etc. = good cameras front and back. Read the Moto/Amazon specs. Amazingly, I have loaded 271 apps with no phone slowing/lag. Just a great durable phone. I would absolutely buy another and recommend it totally. Disclaimer: I am not affiliated in any way with the phone product, other than having purchased and using it. BTW, about two years ago I had excellent Moto service in replacing a Moto X battery. I have really tried (unsuccessfully) to find something to complain or be grumpy about. Can't."
17713,"4g doesnt work, despite the bands are OK. Operator says that its blocked for my region. The description should say that its only for a limited region..."
55357,I got for a family member she like so far Thanks again
62159,"A phone with a large screen was what we were looking to buy, when we found this one. We are overall pleased so far with all aspects of this purchase!"
61522,"Before buying it, I was in a Spiral because I never knew if it would be compatible in South Africa. I took the leap and clicked the purchase button. When I got it a week later, I was greeted with mixed feelings. The Box was not the original, nor were the charging cable and adapter. I immediately purchased a replacement cable and charging block to sort out that issue. Still no quick charge though, which is a bit of a bummer, but I guess I will figure my way around that. Coming from my Mate 10 Pro which has outstanding battery life and fast charge My major concern was the condition of the device, battery life and the fear that the Screen is as bad as reviews I have read and watched. I must say upon initial inspection, I did notice minor chips and scratches, a bit of a damper on my purchase because some reviews claim receiving spotless units. Due to the price I paid, I accepted it, and understand that it is a refurbished unit and overlooked the scratches and chips. At this price you cannot expect a brand new device. With that said, its the only thing that has really been an issue for me. Furthermore, the Pixel 2 XL is everything that I expected it to be. The screen is not as punchy and bright as the Mate 10 or my previous Note 8, it is not bad either. The battery is outstanding, the charging times are just ""NORMAL"" but the snappy software,regular software updates, amazing camera, stereo speaker sound quality, software features and everything that comes with the PIXEL makes me feel great about my purchase. Guess my excitement might be because its not sold in our country, but I do not care! PROUD PIXEL 2 XL OWNER!"
28306,"Phone arrived very late, was supposed to be gold but we got silver. The phone was also supposed to Verison & Straight Talk compable, but it was not."
4201,"This was advertised as unlocked. It is no contract, but locked to AT&T. Don't trust a seller that doesn't understand the difference."
27320,"My previous Note 3 was great. This one has to be defective. It has been freezing since I received it. It goes black. The screen freezes. Sometimes, it won't let me answer a call, the screen just will not respond. The back casing was brittle like it had dry rotted. I ended up putting my old back on the new phone. Now, the battery drains quickly and the phone gets hot to the touch whether I am talking on it or not. Bought a warranty but they told me to call Samsung."
57420,"Works great so far, and the condition was excellent no marks or scratches anywhere. Arrived on time."
35493,"I'm still using it. I like it. Hope battery lasts longer, but I know it's used."
73463,The only problem we are having is not being able to text pictures. But I feel this is user error
54277,"So I tried another Asus phone to find it did not work on the Tmobile network like it claimed. This one does. Overall I love the phone. Thin, lightweight, speedy, rarely any issues to speak of. It takes good quality pics (For a cell phone). Clear crisp screen. Very responsive. Overall a solid phone. I'd probably keep this thing a good long time if it weren't for the fact you cannot find cases and screen protectors for it. Even ASUS itself fails in this, offering pretty much nothing. I *did* finally find a decent screen protector from Skinomi, which worked like a charm. Most of the cases I have found will fit the 5.2 but not the 5.5. I don't know about anyone else, but I drop my phone at least once a week. So this is a bit of an issue. I did finally find a couple that fit but are over all kind of meh cases. (Dear god I miss my custom cases from Skinit). Even the custom places don't cover this phone. It's annoying and frustrating. And it really shouldn't be that hard to find something if you aren't of the Samsung or Apple hive mind. Step it up Asus. You have a quality product here that I could readily get behind but you aren't offering the other things most of us need."
11762,Good for the price. Microphone goes out often on phone calls. Have to toggle speakerphone
69897,Quick delivery and very satisfied. Definitely recommend.
18413,Very good conditions ... the equipment complied with the specifications ... I am satisfied
60538,"Had the phone a little over 2 months now, after my Nexus 6P battery issues forced the need to purchase a new phone basically immediately. I wanted something unlocked, and didn't want an iphone or Galaxy, which leaves little options at the regular electronic stores, so I one day ordered through Amazon (which went great) something I thought would match my needs the best. Phone itself is great looking, great size and weight. The fingerprint scanner on the back is one of the most responsive I've ever used, and the optional gestures using that work well too. The general software it comes packaged with are eh. I prefer stock Android, so am running Nova Launcher to avoid EMUI as much as possible or to make it at least feel that way. There are a lot of weird ticks with this phone, and there aren't a lot of third party apps that you can use that integrate smoothly. The stock dialer is ugly and messy, but nothing else really works I've tried so I tend to mostly make calls via Google Contacts or by searching for a phone number in Chrome etc. The always on screen notifications are pretty spotty at best, and the notification led is not very customizable, and even if it was the brightness of it is so minimal I can barely see it in regular light. This means I tend to not see important texts or missed calls until much later most of the time, which is pretty obnoxious. I never realized I liked having the always on screen as much as I do, but since half the time it doesn't show the text or missed call icon, even just using the stock apps to send/receive them it really limits the usefulness of this feature. The stock camera software is pretty bad, and the regular color camera just takes ok pics. There are a lot of options that ""camera people"" will enjoy, but having come from the 6P and it's way ahead of everyone camera to this, has been disappointing. If I wanted to tweak settings like I was using a DSLR, I would literally just pull out my DSLR. The B&W camera however is insane, and takes amazing pics, but as I generally only grab pics with my phone for social media stuff or reminder lists, this is a little useless overall and just feels like a gimmick. I've tried a few third party camera apps, but again, the integration is spotty at best, and nothing really seems to make anything better than the not great stock app, so it's a wash. Updates from Huawei appear to be nearly non-existent for the US model, for what appears to be a myriad of reasons. This isn't the place to get into any of the political reasons or how I feel either way, but the lack of updates or hopes of one is pretty wack. EMUI 9/Pie have been rolling out to different international versions of this phone for almost 2 months now, and I'm not even on 8.1 yet. And in the 2ish months I've had the phone now, I've only received 2 security updates. For a flagship phone less than 2 years old in this day and age, that's pretty unacceptable. Especially coming from the 6P, which was getting updates up until December 2018, this has taken some getting used to. The battery is definitely the best part of this phone, with some notes. I've tweaked the hell out of every option I can to get the best settings for me, and how I need my phone to function. That means I override the AI as to what can use the phone when, and what apps have access to what options etc. It's dumb I had to spend hours doing this, but it was worth it. That said, I rarely find myself charging this more than once every 48 hours or so. And when I do, it's almost never to 100% (not because of any rules some blog might have written about for battery optimization, just I haven't needed to), and I still usually get 2 full days out of it. Goodbye are the days when I leave the house with the phone only at 30% and have that nagging feeling in the back of my head all morning that I need to find a place to charge it up. That alone makes up for many of my other complaints with this phone, because I've had some amazing phones over the years that could barely pull 8 hours on a full charge with how I used them, but this thing is a beast in that department so put that in the pros column for sure. Overall, I doubt I would recommend this phone for most people. People wanting an unlocked experience, with the option to customize your rom or any of the other perks that comes with it, forget about it. If you're literally just trying to have a phone you can swap providers with easily, there are better/cheaper options. EMUI is far too invasive and lacks basic options many of us are used to if you've ever used stock Android, iOS, or any flagship Samsung phone, and would be pretty frustrating to use for someone who isn't a phone nerd, but said phone nerd would be pretty turned off by the limits of this phone so why bother? And as there's basically no third party ROM support for this phone due to many issues, the viability of this phone once official support is cut off means this thing is already pretty obsolete. I definitely regret my purchase, and know I could return the item to Amazon even now because their policy is pretty robust in that regard, but I don't think I'd feel right doing that. So for now I'll ride this thing out, wishing the 6P was my forever phone and had a new huge battery with updates, and plan to replace my Mate 10 Pro by fall of 2020 when I am sure it will be a paperweight by then."
69328,"The phone looks advanced and fancy, the seller is cooperative too.."
2438,I don't ask for much with a cheap prepaid phone like this. It does everything that it needs. I'm satisfied.
19434,"Great phone, still had factory plastic on the inner screen."
77108,This phone is awesome but I'm having a problem with not receiving calls. Reason I gave it 4 stars. I have to keep restarting the phone. Would love to be able to figure out why it's doing this but can't figure it out. Features are awesome & it's very fast! Nice size! It's narrower then my old phone & easier to hold with 1 hand.
1270,"Phone keeps restarting after five minutes of use, as doenst come with warranty i just bought the most expensive paperweight bad product"
13733,"I've tried two of these now. The second one I made sure was advertised as ""NEW"". The call quality was horrible on BOTH. It constantly cuts out during calls and makes me sound garbled to the other party. Had this phone actually functioned as a phone I would be giving a 5 star review, all other aspects of it were excellent. Unfortunately now I have to look at other brands because I can't afford an s7 or s8. Such a disappointment, my last 3 phones have been galaxies."
1174,"The phone randomly restarts, Bluetooth does not pair, it freezes up 2-3 times per day. Battery life is <10 hours. Samsung support is completely worthless."
82010,Wife loves the phone. Big upgrade over prior androids.
22984,"I lost my money when i bought this for my brother. And when he tried to connect it to his service provider it was still locked and under an account that owed thousands of dollars. Not happy at all with this Amazon, not only was i robbed of my money, i accidentaly robbed my brother of the joy if having the one gift he's wanted for months."
18432,This phone lasted me about 6-8 months before the battery burned out along with some really expensive parts as in what I paid for the phone itself . The phone was perfect for me but I wouldn’t buy refurbished again .
16132,"Just got this phone March-2015, it's Made in Vietnam instead of Made in China, not sure if that's better or worse. Anyhow, I found out it can't read my class4 micro SD card( the card works fine in other phones and card reader), not sure if it's compatibility issue or the phone's SD card slot is broken. I will try some other micro SD card later on, a class 10 maybe. Pro: inexpensive Con: 4GB space can't really do much when it can't read SD card (Fixed). I was expecting lumia 530 has at least the same amount of internal space as Lumia 520 (8GB) , but nope. For almost the same price, get Lumia 635 instead!!! Update- after a few days of playing, finally got it to work - solution is simple: just freaking reset (Setting--About--reset) the phone while the Micro SD card is in place. Before resetting it, I tried with class 4 /10, Sandisk and other Micro SD cards, with NTFS/FAT32/exFAT file systems..anything that I can think of, it just did not work . with NTFS - it says ""format require"" - hit format- "" SD card format failed, please use other SD Card"" with other FAT file system - ""SD Card not found"" Crappy SD card format solution / programing, wasted hours of my time, still 2 stars."
16848,"Bought this for mom. She loves it. Screen had no scratches whatsoever. Everything worked perfectly, and it was only $89. An absolute steal... <3 it."
44462,This phone worked great and arrived in a timely manner
58904,"It was delivered before the expected date of shipment and in mint condition! I couldn't believe that this high tech device was selling for such a low price! I also downloaded the beta android Q software which is a free software option, and has no defects so far. Very impressed!"
47576,"For its price, this phone is a steal. I originally purchased a Xiaomi Pocophone F1 and was disappointed, and decided to replace it with the S8+. Its incredible how the S8+ outperforms. I'll list a few things worth considering if you're thinking about getting an S8+. The display's color and contrast are top of the line. I've been using an s9+ for awhile now as my personal phone and had gotten use to its vibrancy and depth, after giving the Pocophone F1 a shot I realize Samsung's AMOLEDs are just out of this world amazing. Granted the F1 is an IPS display, but from a user experience perspective alone the S8+ really delivers if visuals are a priority to you. The S8+'s speed and performance are fantastic. The hardware you get for this price point is amazing, where my S8+ performs about 95% as fast as my S9+ when using demanding software. The phone's glass and metal exterior is very durable, handling drops well and not scratching with common items. I do have one complaint, however: the fingerprint scanner's location is pretty terrible. If you have smaller hands, I imagine it will be difficult to reach. I would have preferred it to be centered below the camera instead of beside it. All in all, for a little under $400 you won't find a phone remotely as exceptional as the S8/S8+. Samsung has always been the go-to name for flagship android devices, and this phone is an example of why that is."
60102,"DO NOT believe those who claim this phone does not get LTE in the US...Amazon has for some reason a few bad sellers, selling fakes or perhaps the XT1803, which is the model with mostly international bands, ruining this great phone's rating. I have had the XT1806 32GB version in Lunar Gray for almost 15 months now. It has been a fantastic buy for the $269 I paid. ... On an account direct from TMobile this phone has VoLTE, WiFi calling - all the advertised features. If this phone had wireless charging and a just-slightly better camera, I would pay $499 for it, knowing what I know today. I recently looked at LG V35, Samsung 8+ (used), to replace my wife's Samsung J7, but the clearance on G5s Plus at $209 was our choice. Rock solid construction, great speaker phone , Android 8.1, .....just a real deal. PS: The G5s Plus is a better phone than even the $459 LG G7 I just checked yesterday and had thought it was going to be fantastic. Nope - low volume speakers with tinny sound, very easily cracked body, not much better camera, even goes into looping on startup according to a lot of reviewers."
36341,"These phones were not unlocked but preloaded for Att. Which means they were completely useless with my phone plan. They seemed to be as advertised otherwise, but considering the entire reson I bought was for the unlock, I am pretty mad. Now I have to go through the headache of getting another new phone. Plus I have to listen to my wife tell me she was right and thay we should have just bought our phones in store full of bloat ware."
4707,"I've had android and iOS, and I finally made the switch to Windows Phone last year with the HTC 8x. I immediately fell in love with the OS, but was nor impressed with HTC's quality. The Nokia Lumia 928 is exactly what I was looking for! Superior screen resolution, camera and on board storage, not to mention all of the Nokia specific apps. If you want WP on Verizon, this is it. If you're on iOS or android, give WP a try. You won't be disappointed. Nokia Lumia 928, White (Verizon Wireless)"
23602,Great phone. Came in great shape. Don't try to get a SIM by calling Sprint. Goto a Sprint store with a service center.now that I have the SIM. Works great.love this phone.
24599,Bought it as a gift and so far it has worked perfectly fine.
60025,Phone works great my daughter was happy to get this for Christmas.
11683,"I love the phone itself, but the back part has already cracked. I literally had it in my case the whole time and took it out so i could check on it and it was broken on the back in two spots. I guess that means it isn't waterproof now but its still the phone i really wanted so im not sending it back."
15175,this is the best phone I've ever owned I love all the features you should get it!!!
12119,"Love the phone for the most part. I can't do a 5 star because there a FEW things that could be done better/different. I wish the back cover actually screwed on instead of snapping in place like the ""regular"" S5. The home/volume/activity key is little too easy to press for me. If it were in a case it would be perfect, but if you plan on not using a case like me just know that the buttons on the side are very easy to press. Not a problem for me until I have headphones plugged in and I go to put the phone back in my pocket with the headphone jack facing up so I don't bend or break the cable. Normally the phone goes in my pocket with the jack facing down and screen toward my leg so this isn't a factor."
57429,"Do not buy. It isn’t fully unlocked. I got sent 2 phones that were still locked to Verizon, and after calling the company they never answered. Amazon ended up sending me a replacement after the first phone failed to work with my carrier, and it was still unable to support it. Very disappointed and not worth the headache."
67576,"Stock Android is better than bloatware filled alternatives, but a simple dark mode would have been appreciated. The hardware inside doesn't age well and the phone feels slow just 6 months later. Horrendous proximity sensor and it has some annoying bugs and random lag as time goes on. It's better to spend a bit more on their Pocophone F1 which is way better value for the money."
70756,I have no complaints love this phone 😍 5 stars Amazon
61247,"I'm going middle of the road. Battery life, rugged design (friends and co workers thought the phone had a case), and a pure upgrade to the S7 active were all pluses. However, the phone kept resetting itself. I looked online and on Youtube to see if the problem could be solved on my end, because operator error is a thing, and I took the steps necessary to see if it solved the problem. Unfortunately it did not. If there is a takeaway from my this report is to check the warranty and turn it in if you buy one and experience this issue. I didn't look and was too late when I found out and am stuck with this phone. Keep in mind, again, this is a good phone. However the one I bought had a tendency to reset itself over and over again. If your phone does this, send it back. Don't make my mistake."
51132,"I was very impressed when I unwrapped the mini 4. There wasn’t a mark on it! It was charged at 92% and turned on without incident. I plan to use it for drone flying only. I loaded the app I needed, all is well. I’ve have used it to fly several times and am very pleased. The only odd part is the charging. I connected to the same lightening cable I use for my phone and it stopped at 85%. After a little research I used a new charger and cable I already had and it went to 100% no problem."
28507,"My old S7 was glitchy and had a lot of battery drain although the device maintenance said that it was excellent. So I got this S7. Unfortunately this phone is the same or worse. Glitchy, cannot download updates, excessive battery drain. Piece of crap. Supposed to be new but still sucks. Definitely NOT WORTH THE MONEY."
23462,"Excellent phone, great connectivity and sound quality. I've been told on the other side of phone conversations about the clarity of sound when I use this phone. I utilize 2 phones this Note 5 and a Samsung Galaxy S6, one for business and the other for personal use. Also an important distinction is the battery life of the Note vs the S6, the Note has up to 2.5× more use time than the S6. I plan on selling my S6 and purchasing another Note 5, I highly recommend this phone."
42236,"This was the 2nd phone I purchased from Mywit. I bought this one because the first one didn't work. This one had a bad mother bored I guess. That's what Mywit said it sounded like because it kept shutting down. There return policy is horrible. They only do what they said they were gonna do on the phone after you send a message to them through the Amazon system. Then are sure to say in the message. ""We already"" no you did not you did it after. Time stamps. Anyhow. Don't buy from Mywit."
49579,"I bought this for my wife last July and it work until last last Monday when the home button and the right button stopped working. I did some troubleshooting and called Nokia, nothing. I called Amazon and after 50 minutes troubleshooting the device Amazon offered me $100 less than what I paid. I have never given a bad review or had issues with Amazon before. This is unacceptable."
5044,I think for the price this is a great deal and it is a great cell phone Ive had no problems with it at all. Thanks
59891,"Product stated it was a Verizon phone, however I received a Tmobile phone. Still works on my network but not as well. I am unable to use many features/apps that would be on a verizon phone. (Verified TMobile via Samsung)"
53367,"Sim tray came bent, but I repaired it to get t working."
27322,"I dislike the fact that my phone is not working properly. When I make a call, it calls someone I didn't click. Other Strang actions have been happening, I can't even explain."
2138,"I bought this phone for my 85 year old father. He doesn't quite understand it, but it was easier for him to understand than a android phone. We used this phone as an ATT Go-Phone. No problems there."
8613,Battery losing ability to charge. Want a new battery under warranty send yours in and wait 10 days for us to send you one. No way to swap. Samsung has terrible customer service. I have a large number of Samsung products but this is the last one. Any time there is an issue with any of their products it is essentially the customer's problem.
33410,Totally awesome phone. Can't say anything bad about it. 1price can't belive it phone has curved glass display bright beautiful. Camera haven't seen a better one had a iPhone 6plus s. This phone is better. Fast processor great buy this or the xz if you want a smaller one. If sony would advertise and had there phones in all the cell stores there would be no Samsung or Apple. Premium phone at a cheap price.
35909,I like it but I bought it used. Sometimes you can't call out or get calls but I pain $277 for it so it works great for what I paid. I am thinking of buying a new (not used)one because it is a great phone.
70686,If the the refurbish card didn't come inside the box I would of honestly thought it was new. It looks great.
53001,Received the phone and it is locked to T-mobile... I have boost. Don’t buy if you don’t want to go through any problems.
22989,"Bought this from Topshop direct. Details were used like new, in box. The only thing wrong with it was a few peck marks on the screen, but after installing a screen protector you can't even see them at all. It is GSM unlocked, not bootloader unlocked (att). Phone works great with no problems. Do not like--nonremovable battery, no sd card slot, surely a Samsung goof up. Good purchase, definitely satisfied."
24758,Amazing if I knew I wouldon't get another one.. Will buy again for sure. Packaging could have little more protection so box with phone will not bounce around. Otherwise amazing
46714,The phone that I bought is no good it goes off by itself and stay off for hours
78338,"I hesitated a ton buying this phone renewed, constantly reading other reviews, videos about buying Iphones online but I finally decided to go through with it since I had Amazon's return policy to give me confidence. Once I received the package, I found I had nothing to worry about at all, it arrived in amazing condition, with a charger and wall adapter; I would recommend buying Amazon renewed Iphones to anyone now, no regrets whatsoever and I saved money!"
44560,Got this phone and right out of the box it won't charge. This is not acceptable
57775,"Phone came shipped with a glass screen protector which is a nice touch. Product was everything I expected, IOS says battery health is at 88% which is normal considering it’s age, overall very pleased with my purchase. Will definitely be buying from this merchant again when I need a new phone."
46831,"This phone is amazing! Battery lasts forever, pictures are amazing, and the phone is extremely fast. I would (and have) recommend this phone to everyone looking for a new phone at a perfect price. The only issue I have found is the phone screen smudges easily but is corrected by a simple phone screen."
57254,was pretty scared to order this phone but very satisfied when i received
33396,"Didn't buy this on Amazon, happened to have a coupon for Best Buy and decided to get it there. I really wanted to love this phone, but I had so many issues. Pro's: liked the camera 21MP, loved the large display Con's: Heavier than most phones, issue with it switching networks sometimes little to no signal, when my husband's phone on the same plan/network has a full LTE signal. Consistent Bluetooth issues, it initially pairs easily but regularly has connectivity issues. Not waterproof, a lot of bloat ware that takes up the majority of the memory. I'm disappointed because I expected a lot more from Sony and thought I could hold on to this phone for a while, but now I'm on the lookout for another reasonably priced unlocked phone."
63259,Works great with Verizon and T mobile . This phone is totally amazing . Great value !
42380,Fast delivery and arrived in perfect shape. Two differences between this and a new iPHone... The Cost! and the word Refurbished. Update... have now bought 3 of them and all were and still are perfect.
42407,Works perfectly. When I got it the ends of the screen would click but don't anymore. Mod attatchments work perfectly.
47666,tried to trade in the phone to Samsung for a credit. The phone came up as blacklisted meaning the device was reported lost or stolen. WTF
36501,The iPhone is excellent. I had my doubts about buying a refurbished phone but it looks perfectly new. The only issue is that I didn't get earpods with my iPhone. Although i'm not sure if refurbished phones come with earpodes.
80809,I GOT BRAND NEW SAMSUNG GALAXY M30 WITH 128GM FREE EXCELLENT PHONE $229
32314,"Phone came in new condition in the original box with USB data cable and charging block. It was clean and was factory reset. Installed my AT&T sim card and received service without any issues. The Samsung Galaxy S7 Edge is a beautiful phone. Unfortunately, it is a fingerprint magnet! It is also very slippery so dropping it is inevitable without a skin or a case. Installing a skin prevents the slippage but takes away from the aesthetics. You could install a clear case but that adds bulk. Since it has a curved display, the screen cracks easily. The back of the phone is worse since its just regular glass. If you purchase this phone, be gentle. If you are prone to dropping your phone, look elsewhere."
78624,This phone is unlocked and works great my carriers that I have when I'm travelling through the countryside . I do not know what these other buyers are talking about saying it is locked. 100% recommend this product. 😀
70610,"I like the phone itself. However it's broken. This phone does not work properly. Im very dissapointed!! First of all, this phone was advertised as being "" Unlocked "" however its locked with AT&T. I can't believe it ya'll. Let me tell you something else wrong. Every now and then through out the day it will start playing a weird sound. It sounds like an airhorn. Then after, it will start glitching and shuts off. ALSO it powers on and off through out the day non stop. You cant use it because once you try to do something it starting blowing an alarm and power on and off every few seconds. I was so excited for this phone to come in the mail. Now i have to exchange. I'm not sure if that was a good choice because they might send me another broke phone. But i'm going to try. Ya'll say a prayer. I got the phone next to me. It's shutting on and off right now while i'm typing this. Completely disappointing It was shuttering and make horn noises. I cant believe this. Isn't this phone suppose to be in ""new' condition. So disappointed. SMH"
53874,Since I purchased a refurbished Note8 I was apprehensive about the condition it would be in when I got it. If I didn't know it was refurbished I would have believed it was new. What a pleasant surprise !
44956,"Came in 3days looks brand new took it to metro,pcs. They hooked it in 10min. No problems Verry Happy with My iphone SE."
66963,"Amazing phone for the price!! No complaints whatsoever, overloaded in every aspect for the money. Android 8.1 out of the box verified. 64 GB internal memory verified. 4GB of RAM verified. I have an after market fast charger and it works just fine for quick charge. Battery life is great. You do have to change the region to India in order for the face unlock feature to become an available option, but it works beautifully. Came with a case, but recommend buying a thicker style case due to the rear camera sort of protruding outward just a bit (scratch risk). Phone doesn't feel cheaply made at all. The one thing I cannot vouch for is durability because I haven't dropped it or beat it up much. I've also only had the phone for a couple of weeks so I can't speak on it's longevity. 5 stars for the money, you'd be hard pressed to find a used/outdated Apple or Samsung for the price."
17693,Exactly the same as the one it replaced which fell and shattered the screen. Very nice Windows Phone and synced everything right back up.
43444,The phone looked brand new and has been working perfectly fine since I got it about 2 weeks ago.
79831,I have a HUAWEI Mate 9 it works good still but Android 8 looks like that's it so I Bought this Xiaomi Redmi Note 7 128GB to use With T Mobile and it works Flawless. The only con was the Camera is not A $800. Dollar equivalent to Higher Price Phones But it work and is always Clear Even Night Shots. Speaker is Loud. Phone Looks and Fells Great. $200. is hard to beat. Update: Could not send Data to Others (Pictures) Took to My T-Mobile Corporate They Found Some Settings were not Correct For the APN Took About 15 Min but Now its perfect was not the Phone Just Settings. Added some basic Pics I took with it today. I think the camera Does a Good Job. Wife wants one Now.
54463,"The only thing good about this phone is the battery life it do last a long long time ... but it very slow an it’s like the more apps I down load the slower it gets, an no I would not recommend this phone to anyone that use there phone alot...."
7078,"Had a serious battery drain issue. I' m talking a couple hours and a recharge was needed. There are numerous references online concerning this problem and several ""fixes"" which sounded like a helluvulatta trouble. I sent the phone back."
14176,Excellent phone. Very good cost benefit. Higly recomended.
4202,The phone is slender and compact but has internet access. A good phone for the price and I would recommend the product.
17398,The phone works just as it should and the phone showed up in great condition. Thank you.
31539,Battery crapped out after 6 months and had to be replaced. Phone died within two months of that.
516,This is a great phone i have had it for about a year no problems at all. I accually bought a different phone becuase i wanted a slide phone it has a better rating but its not near as good as this phone.the battery life is amazing last me 2-3 days of use. It has great sound quality. pretty much the best phone cuz there is little things about it that just make everything so easy to use. i give it a 6 out 5 i will buy again
66698,I returned it back. Cuz it didnt have LTE support internet. And chinese version of it
72307,"I love the large screen, with so many great features and easy to navigate. Love the teal color too. I have Cricket cell phone service and everything transferred over very easy."
72534,"UPDATE: After contacting support they informed me that when using MetroPCS you must activate the new phone phone before it will show it is unlocked. Phone is working great now with no defects so far Phone not unlocked and has AT&T bloatware, sold by wireless-globe. Will try to contact customer support."
30320,"Very pleased with my order ,it was exactly what I purchased. It was delivered fast and before delivery date."
35456,"item listed as : some minor markings from normal use, such as light scratching or scuffs. There is no damage. No cracks, chips, or deep scratches on the screen. HOWEVER, THIS ITEM HAS TONS OF DEEPS SCRATCHING AN SCUFF DAMAGE AND DEEP SCRATCHES ON THE SCREEN."
9346,"Worked fine right out of the box. I put my old SIM card into it and it worked right for a week and then stopped. Talked to AT&T, it turns out I need a new SIM card (which they gave me at no charge) since my old SIM card still said Cingular on it, that's how old it was. Working fine now."
59419,"There are many choices in the $200+ category, perhaps led by the Moto G series that works with the big four US phone carriers. The Sony L2 on the other hand only works with the GSM carriers. But it has NFC (if you are interested in using contactless payments like Android Pay), and USB-C (the ""new"" connector of the future) instead of microUSB. It has a fingerprint reader on the back (works well, I didn't have any false positives). Despite the USB-C connection, it is USB version 2.0, not 3.x. And it does not support USB Host / OTG. Charging is slow, it takes about 3 hours from empty to full. It's the slowest device to charge among everything that I recharge on a regular basis. Battery life is about average. It get about two days but I pay attention to app battery use and data use and uninstall the hungry ones. The screen is big enough you can use the mobile version of many websites these days. 3GB of RAM was a great idea, as it gives you more flexibility when you are multitasking. It's under 1GB RAM free most of the time, so had they given it 2GB of RAM, it would be suffering. I don't play games or run intense apps. Web browsing, music, productivity, weather, and payment apps and the like all work fine without stalling. Overall, it feels good in the hand. I haven't fumbled it yet. A case is not a bad idea either if you are a fan of using cases. The phone has its one One Handed use feature which gives you a smaller screen box that you can move around. It is useful for some apps that may have large buttons or simple navigation, like timers. Harder to use with something like a web browser. Easy to activate by swiping diagonally upwards from either the bottom left or bottom right edge of the screen. Sony's Xperia UI and custom apps are not the worse of customizations but they are not stock Android either. Disable or turn off anything that you don't plan on using, so they don't buzz around in the background eating battery and data. There are some other pre-installed apps that can be disabled but not uninstalled. The Home Screen grid can be adjusted, and it's not a huge screen with high resolution, so I didn't install a 3rd party Home Screen. For regular use, I find the 720p screen to be fine for my needs: the videos I watch are of the YouTube kind, not movies. Speaking of the screen, it has an Adaptive brightness mode which works pretty well but it takes 1-2 seconds to adjust, for example if you going in and out of shade (eg walking under trees on a sunny day) you feel like it should have adjusted about 1-2 seconds earlier to the change in lighting. The screen loves collecting fingerprints, so keep a microfiber cloth handy. It is readable in the middle of the day outdoors at maximum. The power saving mode is customizable, it doesn't have to start at 15% remaining, but once it starts it doesn't let you increase screen brightness (hard to read outdoors). There's also an Ultra Stamina mode which makes it more of a phone than a smartphone when you are close to empty. The audio, both the speakers and the standard headphone jack are about as you would expect for the price range. The single speaker is on the bottom right corner of the phone. You can quickly almost mute it by covering it with a finger (eg if someone is trying to tell you something over the music). You have about 21 GB free out of the box (it has 32GB total), and a microSD drive if you want to add more. It runs Android 7.1.1 with the November 2017 security patch level as of review time. I do not know if Sony has plans to put Oreo on it."
32446,I absolutely love this phone. The seller was fantastic to work with.
36804,"The phone was in good condition cosmetically with minor imperfections. However, there was something wrong with the hardware such that it frequently lost cell reception. I ended up returning it."
247,"The phone arrived with some scratches on the front and back, and I was a little disappointed when I saw the keypad was weathered and worn more than I'd like, but considering it's an 8+ year old phone, it's in very good condition. The screen, dial pad, speaker, everything works as it should. Had no problem activating it on to my existing verizon account. The included charger works great, however the battery was pretty weak, it only lasts about 10 hours or so on a full charge. Just order a replacement battery to be safe, (they're a few bucks) the phone lasts for days now with the new battery. Good phone though, good seller"
41012,"I originally bought this phone to upgrade from my old 5S I absolutely love it! However I am not able to use it with Verizon as the description states! Was hoping I would be able to because some of the other reviews said that it would work with Verizon but, mine doesn't also it would be Smart to pay attention to the seller. I bought mine from dealFisher. The reason I'm not going to return this is 1 because i'm absolutely in love with the phone . The camera is awesome and the sound is awesome. And 2 because I already bought a phone case for it. Every gigabyte I ordered is on there and the phone was exactly as described. So, I guess I'll use this phone for Facebook and use my old 5S as just a phone. I would suggest if you're on Verizon don't buy this phone unless you're using it for social media and things of that nature. If anything changes I'll come back and update this review."
29717,"Horrendous. Phone was on for less than 1 hr and half of the screen turned static. Absolute waste of money and time. Hopefully I can get my money back for this worthless ""New"" piece of garbage."
36040,"I give 1 star because I cannot put ZERO STAR: The seller sent me a bad phone. I cannot even start it on, the screen was incessantly blinking. The seller accepts to refund me but I need to pay myself the return shipping. IT WAS NOT MY FAULT THAT THE CELL PHONE DELIVERED TO ME DID NOT WORK. I CANNOT TRUST THIS SELLER AND WILL NEVER RECOMMEND HIM"
6660,"Some difficulties using it overseas on foreign networks but overall it has been a great phone. Due to language barriers, the errors the phone gives me can't seem to be fixed by the mobile phone companies in town. The camera works OK, it was my main reason for purchasing the phone with data & cell service. I think my old HTC takes better pictures with a lower pixel count. It's difficult to adjust the camera settings and it seems to want to ignore screen saving settings. Sometimes it will dim in 15 seconds and other times it will stay on all night. I have done searches and can't seem to find a way to fix this setting or where the conflicting times/programming is located to have it dim & lock quickly to save battery life. It needs to be darkened or it will only last 1/2 day on a full charge. It was much less expensive than other unlocked phones. I find the quirks almost par for the course - I am overseas, with a phone I purchased in the States, on a network and country that has very limited English - I could have waited until I arrived in-country and purchased an unlocked Samsung or Iphone. However, I didn't know what the pricing and options would be prior to my arrival. It's served to be what I needed and seems to be reliable and predictable."
80587,"The phone came is good condition but the only problem is that is was a bit dusty when I took it out of the box. The box also looks like it fell and the corners are pushed in. Overall the phone looks in good condition. The only concerning part of it is that the box says only use in India sim, but the description says that it’s international sim."
56545,"So, I was kind of sceptical about buying a renewed phone but I'm so glad I did. When I turned the phone on it started as tmobile but it gave me a prompt to reset and update the phone to my carrier (verizon). There are no scratches or anything. It literally looks like I bought this phone brand new from the store. 10 out of 10... would purchase again from this seller if I ever needed another phone. I got the same quality as I would have from the store for A LOT less money."
63898,"I bought this phone WITHOUT the Amazon integrations. I've read that they can't be disabled or removed from that models version of Android, but I can't confirm that. That said, I did find it to be a big enough issue that I paid a little more the version without it. I love this phone. I switched from an Essential Ph1 and have owned pretty much every Samsung flagship released in the past 5 years. I'm on a personal boycott of Samsung after they failed to honor my warranty on my Note, but that's another review on a different website. I honestly don't like theiecosystem and experience that Samsung has built. It kinda feels like a bizarre version of iOS at times. Moving on... With the ZPlay 3, I really see little difference other than the frequency of updates provided by Motorola, Motorola is significantly slower, and the lack of any fluff and customization as provided by Samsung. Essential basically releases updates immediately after Google, so the bar is extremely high in that regard. Motorola has been slower to release updates than I would like, but the updates have been flawless. This phone has very little bloatware. It's extremely close to stock Android and really quick. I've had zero issue and very little slow down if any. I rarely play games on my phone, but have no gameplay issues when I do. Load times aren't terrible, but they certainly aren't the fastest. Think Mustang, not Corvette. Motorola should've had the latest OS update to this phone way faster, but their customization of Android mimicked it pretty well. The motomads are pretty cool. I basically always have the extra battery on unless I'm using the projector to screen Netflix on the hotel ceiling if traveling. Battery life is close to two full days in this configuration. It will even get you through a full work day without the extra battery. Not having the fastest processor on the market actually helps a bit in that regard. I do love using the projector mod while paired with a a good Bluetooth speaker. The factory speaker sounds pretty good, but isn't loud enough if more than one person is trying to listen. Bottom Line: If you don't want to spend flagship money this phone will serve you well. If you have no need for the mods, check out the Motorola G7. It's a great budget phone and can be had cheaper than the ZPlay 3."
7399,I would have liked this if it wasn't contracted with AT&T.
35428,Work fantastic. I haven't had any issues with it since I received it. Yes it's refurbished but. I've had a few little scratches on the back but besides that the phone works fantastic and one little scratch on the screen but haven't had any issues.
79447,"This phone is amazing.... I was skeptical about buying this phone but after getting it and using it for daily use I was amazed at how quick and responsive it is. The screen looks amazing, clear correct colors not over saturated. The screen at the top around the notch has a bit of bleed through but you can turn off the notch and not even see it. But for me it's not a deal breaker. The antenna in this phone is great I get more bars with this phone than I did with my LG G7. Battery life is great lasts 2 days with moderate to heavy use. The mi 10 UI is fine you can tweak the phone the way you want. Why pay hundreds of dollars for a flagship US phone, when these under dog phones are going unoticed. The camera is amazing as well. I would definitely recommend this phone to all my friends. It's a good phone at a good price not breaking the bank."
79431,"I've had this phone for about a month and hav been using for about 3 weeks now. The picture quality and battery life are great! The phone came with a European type charger as these phones aren't designed to be sold in the US yet. Two days ago I made a call to my wife while we were both at the supermarket. I called her to find her in the store. I could hear he voice fine. Yesterday, I received two calls back-to-back and thought the sound in the earpiece was gone completely or that I may have accidentally set the phone to mute. Turns out there was sound but it was so faint that I couldn't possibly make a call. I tried the speaker function and it worked well. I haven't yet tried hooking up a headset/earbuds to try that function. Here is the kicker, I tried contacting support and the title in the chat window states US support yet they said they do not have technical support for the US. They gave me an email that I sent a message to and I'm now waiting for a response. So, basically, I'm saying that currently Mi (Xiaomi Redmi Note manufacturer) states they have no US support but can sell phones in the US and that I have no usable earpiece function after less than one month use."
46263,"This is a review of the Samsung Galaxy J7 Perx for the Boost Mobile prepaid network. Note this phone is locked to Boost Mobile, there are other versions of the same phone which will be locked to other providers. Do NOT purchase this phone other than for the Boost Mobile network. My Galaxy J7 Perx is replacing a Samsung Galaxy 5. It has a larger screen, and a longer run time. There is a lot of bloat / spy ware included with the phone (Facebook as an example can't be uninstalled). Google spying just comes with Android, it's built in. There is a fair bit of other junk Boost Mobile included (Instagram and other stuff) which can't be removed, some of it (but not all of it) can be disabled. Many complain the phone is slow. If your phone is slow the cause may be a defective phone OR bloatware. Facebook for example must scan all your gmail messages and phone home, this can take both time and resources. Other products will behave similarly, during the initial ""scan"" of your device by the bundled applications the phone may be a bit sluggish. After a while, either by stopping bloat, or letting it run through your stuff, the phone should be relatively snappy. The phone is fast for me, faster than a Galaxy 5 or 6, not as good of course as a Galaxy 8. While it has 8 cores, and can issue 2 instructions (sometimes) per cycle on a 2.3 GHz clock the 8 instruction pipeline doesn't function out of sequence. Thus each instruction must be processed in order. The GPU is fairly powerful, this phone has a 5.5"" screen and may not quite be a phablet phone. It offers 720 x 1200 resolution (not 1080 x 1920). While this is considered HD, it is the lower HD standard, most often used by broadcasters. If you get close to the screen, some pixelation is visible. It has a long run time. On Boost mobile this phone had 5 bars of 4G LTE while my older Galaxy 5 using the same Sprint network via Freedompop had only 2 bars. Download speed for this phone is almost 3 times as fast as the speed for my Galaxy 5 after trying several different locations. It may be due to improved phone technology, or due to Boost Mobile getting better data access than Freedompop, but it is nice to have decent speed. I would have preferred a 7 or 8 inch phone, literally a tablet phone, but my budget didn't permit it. My Boost Mobile plan does have tethering (hotspot) and speeds were about half on the hotspot what they were directly to the phone. So hotspot isn't as fast as a direct 4G connection. My speed on this phone averages about 30 Mbs download and a bit under 9Mbs upload. The play store works well. No fingerprint scanner, for security use a PIN. :( Considering the world we live in, where Facebook, Google and whatever else mines our personal information and adversely affects device performance, this is a decent reasonably low cost phone. The Galaxy J7 Perx goes on sale sometimes for as low as $90, in my case the plan I wanted from Boost Mobile was expiring soon and this caused me to pay $129 per phone, which is still not that bad. The front camera is 8 megapixels and works better in low light than other cameras I've used, a slightly lower resolution camera with better low light capability and less blur is an advantage to a few extra megapixels in my opinion. Play store, Google calendar and what not work well. Samsung by default sticks its browser in the quick launch tab. You will notice a cluster of Google, Samsung and Boost Mobile apps many of which provide similar or identical function. If you want Chrome, just move the Samsung browser out and Chrome in. Chrome is better."
12287,"I like my existing s5 active (2 years old), wanted a new one of same model. I got this one, transferred all phone contents (which is a pain). new phone dropped calls, speaker rattled, etc. Not a new quality phone. only positive is the battery life was better since it was newer than mine. keep looking..."
9231,"This review is for Samsung A157V. Pros: it is a light and straightforward to use no frill cheap phone. Voice quality is decent Cons: no camera. But to be fair it should be expected at this price point though. However, the stand by time sucks. I usually only get three days without even using it."
67168,"I LIKE THIS PHONE. I CHARGE THE BATTERY WITH THE POWER OFF & SEEMS TO TAKE A BETTER CHARGE. I USE IT MOSTLY FOR CALLS, TEXT. AND CAMERA WHICH IS SIMPLE TO SET UP. I MAY TURN OFF GOOGLE BECAUSE DONT SEEM TO NEED IT. I AM GLAD I BOUGHT IT!"
40178,"I was nervous to try refurbished, but it works just fine. Got this for a parent to try an iPhone for the first time & Im really impressed"
54553,"Nokia 2 looks beautiful and also the software is designed well, Front selfie camera is delivering good picture. I liked the display well. Performance is alright.!"
34822,"So far so good. Arrived in like new condition. No noticeable scratches or blemishes on the screen. Battery life is great so far, no issues. Would highly recommend."
50055,"I am someone who takes good care of my phone, I get all the protections and etc. Small complaints... Not in OG box, but some ghetto rigged thing, no pin to take sims card out, and a charging cable that lasted 2 weeks before not working anymore. Big complaints, phone stopped doing talk-to-text with in 3-4 month, even after factory re-set, when I would make a phone call, my phone would just turn off 25% of the time. Month 6, screen starts going green off and on, constant freezing, and black screen that wouldn't turn on half the time ( This is when I ordered a new phone from a new person). I am shocked it only lasted me 6-7 months. I loved it the for 3-4 months and it takes amazing pictures, but I don't believe this refurbished phone was 100% fixed, might of been bad luck, or might be lazy repair work. Either or I'm really bummed about wasting money with this company."
35346,"Buying phones on Amazon is very hit and miss, I was assured by the sellers I would get a North American model but sure enough I get a Chinese model that has been opened and flashed with oxygen os, all Chinese models come with hydrogen os unless it's a 5 or 5T"
43644,The phone was great for 2 months. One day phone decided not to turn back on. So money is wasted on a phone I can't use. Had to go get a brand new phone from mobile. I loved the note 5 but after this purchase I'm done with Samsung.
74886,Said it was network unlocked but I cannot use my tmobile sim card with it. This is the last message I will ever send with this machine. 1 star
24154,This iPhone is the worst product I’ve purchased on amazon. The battery is terrible. The phone does not function when taken off the charger. Even when it is fully charged you onced turned on it will last for about a minute before it shuts down and dies.
12254,This is a refurbished phone and it has many problems that obviously we're not fixed. Not a good purchase. Wish I had just said my money and bought a new phone. Won't be doing this again.
78802,"It said fully unlocked but then further down the page after comparisons when it says product description, you find it is NOT FULLY UNLOCKED! Not compatible with verizon which is what I have"
38761,"The phone doesn't work with T-Mobile SIM card, contacted Sony officials and they told me they do not know which carrier is compatible with Xperia and asked me to contact the seller. According the Amazon representatives, I got a bad phone, they don't have inventory so I have to get a refund. I don't know if I'm the only one experiencing this issue, but it's very annoying. Extra star for good looking"
67628,Lasted less than half a year before battery dead. Unable to charge.
48772,Worst phone I have ever had!!!!! Sometimes things work sometimes they don't.
13726,"After one month the screen flashes and distorts while in certain brightness settings. I decided I could live with it, then after another month the headphone jack breaks, only playing on the right ear despite using multiple sets of headphones. Now I have to go through the hassle of getting another phone sent to me. The phone appeared brand new and not a refurb in any way. Brand new junk, unfortunately."
3665,The device performs well apart from the fact that its battery runs out pretty quickly. Also the seller has not provided any warranty. The seller said it was not branded but it does have AT&T logo and stuff in it. You may as well just buy it from the microsoft store( for the same price) coz in that way you will get the same product but with warranty.
14326,"Amazing phone with a near perfect size. This review is more about misinformation about what is being sold. It is not unlocked- it is an ATTnT locked phone. I have submitted it for unlocking to ATTnT but have not been successful thus far. This phone will likely have to be returned. Shame because it is an amazing phone with great software, hardware, and an ok camera."
51128,I was very pleased with the iPad mini 4. I had one and shattered the glass. It was going to be expensive to repair. So I thought I’d look for a replacement one because I have no issues with the other one I broke. I was excited they had it in more memory. It ended up being about the same as if I’d replaced mine except I have more memory! I got it the next day after ordering it. It is in great physical condition. I haven’t seen any defects. The battery appears to charge all the way up so no problems there either! I am very pleased!
10759,"The phone may be okay (I had a different one from Brightspot) but NEVER, NEVER, NEVER buy anything from them. Their custumer support is beyond terrible. I had a 3 month old phone that stopped working and I was told they did not support the phone and would not help me. It was 3 months old and one of their newer models. If I could give negative stars I would"
51464,"Nice phone, arrived on time, just swapped SEM from my old ATT phone and new one started working. Thanks. 2 weeks into it and everything is working fine. Battery life is something to learn about."
70212,Its looked brand new rigjt out the box and works like new also
66560,"I love Samsung products in general, and this is one of the nicest phones Ive owned. I dont need the latest and greatest, and I think its just foolish to pay 1000 bucks for a phone that will be 1-upped within a few months. So i wait until its about 2 models behind (Samsung is currently selling s9's, so Im buying a 7), and find them in new, or like new condition. Absolutely no complaints. I dont feel im missing out on anything except the empty feeling that comes withh paying about 6 or 7 hundred bucks more for something than you should. 200 to 250 is about my limit for phones, and going at it this way is never a problem."
78421,"Phone was pretty much brand new. No scratches or wear and tear either! Overall I’m very happy that I purchased this phone. Highly, highly recommend!"
5454,this phone was made to be sold in china everything was in Chinese the wifi never worked this phone is extremely slow save your money for something else or at least the one i bought from bluetek usa was this way.
74166,"I bought the phone for my wife and so far it has been a month and I haven't heard any complain from her about the phone. Being an international phone, I knew there will be some downside using in US and I think signal strength will be shady in a congested building specially when using internet. I saw 4G signal with few bars not full signal and LTE signal I guess would not be possible with this version. As long as we get some decent signal, I guess we will be happy. Haven't taken it on the ride to remote areas to really test the signal strength but thats where I am. Again, good phone with all the right features at an affordable price."
81114,"Replaced a very old T-Mobile phone. About on par with a Galaxy S7 or S8. The edges of the screen are very sensitive, so get a phone cover to avoid accidental side screen presses."
586,"I have this phone and the voice quality is too bad and it hardly works with AT & T, i have not tired it with other carriers but have given up on this phone as i have a At & T connection, looking to buy a good non smart phone preferably Nokia...this is the worst phone i ever had even my phone first was not this bad. A big NO NO from my side"
33482,"Great phone, good graphics, allows for a lot of storage, no problems with this phone at all. Very happy!"
54971,"I wanted a phone with just basic phone/text features, but this is terrible. The operating system has been changed since the original 3310, but not for the better. Snake was perfect as is, why add obstacles and moving in diagonals? Often does not have service (despite claiming to be connected) in places all others on my plan have service, so sending/receiving of texts fail and are delayed without warning. Being a minimalist is cool if the simple things you own actually work. This phone is trash"
53358,"The battery lasts a full day with watching YouTube or listening to music, the response is good and after I put a case and cover on this it feels like I could use this for the next few years without issue."
21141,Charged the phone to 100 percent and phone died about 5 hours later with very minimal use
76037,"I took advantage of the Prime Day shopping specials as I was already looking for a replacement to my BB Priv. This phone is conveniently sized for single-hand functions, has a great camera, features plenty of Samsung and Google suite apps and the Smart Switch app was all I needed to transfer all internal content; the nano SIM and the micro SD 200GB card I already had worked flawlessly. I believe this was, for the price hundreds of dollars less than going to Best Buy or AT&T to get a phone unlocked or on a monthly payment plan, the best deal that fit my needs. The phone charges quickly and holds battery power very well. A very good purchase."
18300,"Beautiful phone easy-to-use, however the battery is terrible, even after disabling half of the installed applications the battery would not last a full day with any use at all."
30881,Phone was advertised as unlocked but it is locked to AT&T. Now have to deal with the hassle of returning.
63995,"Let's just say first that I loved this phone. It had an amazing camera, great features, thin and easy to carry, and all around wonderful. But as soon as I got it, I started not receiving all my calls and messages would come in with a delay of 1-2 hours. I finally talked to Huawei and they told me that this phone is only supposed to be an international model not meant for the USA or Canada because it doesn't run on the same bandwidths so you're never going to have decent service. Yeah. Amazon doesn't say any of this in the listing. Bottom line: I returned the phone and got my money back."
81696,"1. OLED display is awesome 2. Plastic build is well-made and does not feel cheap 3. Camera is awesome. Quality is equal or slightly less compared to the bigger brother (Pixel 3) 4. Clicky buttons 5. Hybrid stereo Speaker 6. No notch (Big Thumbs-up from me) 7. Simple and minimalistic design (Personal Preference) 8. Headphone Jack (Although, it is sad to see this as a feature)"
4470,Bought this for my husband and it works great. He loves it. Thank you!
57791,Me agradó recibir a tiempo y en buenas condiciones el celular. Hasta ahora funciona muy bien.
72927,"The battery in my Nexus 6 was getting tired, so I picked up a Moto G series... what a mistake. After suffering for a few months with the Moto, I finally got fed up with it and got this Pixel. Everything about it is better. Faster, no service drops, finger print sensor, camera, volume and power buttons are arrange correctly, the speaker phone is better so I don't miss the microphone jack too much and no Moto crap annoying the hell out of me with no way to completely disable it. Been an Android user since Droid 1 and bought into the Nexus series. Never looking back at Moto or Sammy."
46234,"Had this for about a year and a half and it's not the worst phone, but it isn't the best I've had. Pros: -Low cost for the phone it'self- never worry about breaking it because if it breaks you can just go to walmart and get a new one the same day -camera can take some very good, high resolution pictures -Solid audio Cons -has a hard time mulit tasking. All apps are slow if you just have snapchat still open -slower cpu, making large apps load slowly -battery life isn't bad at all, but not as good as my last phone (Galaxy J3-6) -Wifi isn't very good all around. When you have less than a full connection it will be pretty slow -its a big phone, so it won't fit in most car gps mounts -storage is not as high as I wanted it t be"
4972,Love this new phone. The only problem I have come across is that I found out there is an updated for it but I can't get it to download.
61381,not working please don waste your money in this brand
77666,"Fingerprint sensor is really sensitive but works good. Comes with a plastic screen protector and yellow plastic case to match the phone so you might wanna get better ones. Still comes with headphones and fast charger. Phone runs smoothly with no lag and wifi on the phone is better. Battery can last you from around the morning to evening on full battery. Overall, really good phone for your money I highly recommend. Works with at&t sim card but not verizon or sprint."
19703,"They delivered a NEW unlocked Samsung phone, just as promised. Very prompt delivery and works great!"
9023,I would rate it above the iPhone for many reasonsthe larger HD screen The much better android operating system and the start of the art CPU which has speed and precision. Great connectivity call quality super camera and great memory Watching you tube and movies is fun The sound quality is super Overall I would say this is the best smartphone in the market.
27058,"Oh my gosh! So disappointed. This phone runs hot, turn off and on by itself and the battery take forever to charge and dies within a hour. Horrible phone, they even sent me a broken charger that won't charge."
37165,I'm a huge fan of Sony Xperia Compact phone family and hope they still come up releasing phones like this. I wish they'll come back to the flat screen; the rounded screen is incompatible with glass protections (which are usually very useful...)
56151,"I love Samsung! Great price for the S6. I'm behind the times when it comes to the latest cell phones, so I really appreciate being able to find a great bargain on the brand new older models. Thanks!!"
12176,"Sucks when they dont post picture's of the actual products.. Phone was missing a few waterproof features, and the charging port doesnt work. Shpuld of just bought it new for the price I paid."
54080,"I got an open Box phone from Amazon Warehouse. The first one came with the original box and all the original accessories- it even had some plastic dust cover still on the phone. I was so happy till I checked the imei to discover it was stolen/missing. I contact Amazon and the replaced it immediately, but this time it was a repackage phone. The repackaged phone was a little less new, but works great so far. The battery still last a whole day or so, depending on use. The repackaged phone came in a generic box and only had the original charge base and an amazon basic usb A to usb C cord. Because the phone they replaced had been open box (with an original box), they were able to refund me the money to buy the missing accessories. I imagine if you buy from Amazon/Amazon warehouse used and it indicates being repackaged you should expect to only receive an oem charger with cable. The lack of warranty also makes me a little nervous. As there is no indication to how used the phone I received the second time, I also worry about the longevity of the battery. So cross your fingers for me that this phone is a good one."
9238,"OK phone. But, activation is bizarrely complex, activation required codes hidden on box and in documentation, plus the AT&T support web site pathetic. He web site is especially disappointing when used to activate supporting features such as loading gmail contact into the phone – it doesn’t work. Moreover, one GoPhone account does not mean one set of IDs and passwords. Different AT&T web sites require different ID/password combinations. I thought AT&T was high tech. Trying to set up my new GoPhone has been a exercise in frustration and wasted time. If you want a simple, basic phone – look at other carries first."
27910,"This phone came quickly, looked new, no scratches or anything. Worked fine for 6 months then the power button started sticking, or the screen would stick, or the screen would roll down once I started typing. Now I'm at 7 months and it's not keeping the charge and even when plugged in for hours charges really slowly. I have no recourse at this point. Just doing this review so you can be aware."
34390,It came with a screen protector and case! Overall the product is pretty good the only thing I don't like is the battery health was already at 87% and the storage goes up so fast compared to my android
71897,Me gusta mucho en vez de pagar tanto con la compañía de teléfonos
35780,Firstly service is always good but I bought an unlocked phone but when I placed my sim card the phone is registered to Verizon where it should b unlocked from info on my purchase
67732,I don't like how we don't have a headphone jack and no NFC code
72066,This most value you could get for a smartphone. All the features you can get from a flagship phone at less the price. Arguably the best AI camera.
82257,"All the features were great. I was really liking the phone but I dont recommend getting it through here though, the money aint worth the risk."
31449,Nothing to dislike! Vendor's Galaxy S7 was a replacement for Gen 1 Galaxy S7 w/ a broken screen. Replacement was indistinguishable from new. Battery life is better and rate of recharge is much quicker.
32198,Really great phone and refreshed but a very good condition.
18011,"Completely enjoy my new S6! Nano sim card needed. Easy to install. Very user friendly. Adaptive fast charging is an excellent bonus. LOVE the GOLD colour! The screen is incredibly sharp! Adore the front camera, excellent for all the selfies!"
36685,There is a click noise when I press the home button. It feels so loose and it feels like it will break if I don't press carefully. This especially happens when the weather is cold. I didn't experience the same thing with other iphones. I didn't have any other problem with the phone. Everything else seems okay.
72378,"I love everything about this phone so far. I've had it now for about 2 weeks. Put my sim card in and it worked right away. I have cricket. Works great, perfect size, great storage, love the display and the sounds. I'd definitely like to stay with this brand for awhile.."
67719,"todo bien, no tengo quejas y mas por el precio, buen precio."
21884,"great phone, they give a cheap battery because this one doesn't last as long as it should."
79652,It's a nice smartphone with good cost-benefit. The low rating is because my redmi came with IR sensor not working.
78279,"It arrived on time, I bought for my son, it has great battery life. Good as new, no complaints here."
74230,"Ha sido una gran experiencia haber comprado este producto y haberle entregado mi confianza a HUAWEI, esta nueva linea de producto HONOR es increible, celulares gama media con altisimo rendimiento y caracteristicas que te dejan asombrado. Muy buena compra, el envio fue rapido y efectivo. Muchas gracias! Espero poder disfrutar al maximo este gran smartphone."
25050,"Normal, without information of the. product, no catalogue."
27593,It does not immediately ring when receiving an incoming call.
4232,I am very disappointed in this phone! It went dead after a month! Also I bought a bionic from Amazon and it went dead within a month! This is over $200 of wasted dollars on cell phones that I thought would last much longer? And how would I received my return from both of these terrible cell phones
44591,"Came earlier than expected, which was awesome because it ended up coming on my birthday! Looks like a brand new phone. One very, very little barely noticeable scratch on the back but that’s all I've seen and my case covers it. Was very worried to get this phone, but so far I'm very satisfied. 87% battery maximum capacity too!"
53296,"Beautiful, feels good and very easy to use. Love using the fingerprint security features."
29042,"Good phone and good price, but did not come with the SIM card as expected. This wasn't explained in the description and I bought a new phone in the box. Had to take the phone to Sprint to get a replacement SIM card. Luckily that didn't cost me anything other than time and inconvenience."
69249,"I really love this phone. I was looking for a 64G phone that wouldn't break my bank but Metro PCS didn't have anything affordable. I'm not a tech savvy girl but I know what I like in a phone. This has the storage I need, a decent camera (with the portrait and depth effect features that the iPhone has), and transferring my information from my old phone to my new was a breeze. So far, no issues. Be aware that if you are a Metro PCS customer you will need to call their customer service to have this phone added to your account. You can't do it from the website. Overall, highly recommend."
75798,I like the design very much. Camera quality particularly the wide lens is awesome. But I don't know why the email notification is not shown automatically. I need to check this issue
33836,Good camera (not Galaxy or iPhone level but better than most Androids). Battery is AMAZINGand charges super quick. Clean look and decent graphics. I personally like that it is not too big. All that being said I don't think I'll be getting another Sony phone. It has crashed on me three times and froze while running basic apps and I'm not even a multi app running type of user. It's not bad enough that I'll be running to get a new phone anytime soon but I probably won't be keeping this one long either (my ancient LG was more reliable)
53379,"I dont like this Cell fone, next time i will buy one better. Slow ram, slow processor, slow camera. only for those who do not have the money to buy a better one, because it is not worth the amount paid."
61613,Nicely made. I'm not one for fancy titanium backs and such as I just cover it up. Google put value inside. Wish it has a slot though.
15764,The S5 Active is doing exactly what I needed... a tough-durable quality phone to utilize as the GPS on my motorcycle as well as a practical phone and fantastic camera.
42081,"Skeptical at first, but works perfect on verizon for me! It is what i am using now...."
14511,Shut itself off every few minutes/overheated instantly. Returned.
52775,"Delivered early in mint condition.No wear, not even the slightest flaw back or front, a great deal."
1641,"My son is 13 and needless to say is rough on phones, we got him this phone as a replacement phone and it is really simple to use and all he needs. It came very quickly and in great condition."
51510,"Excellent condition, charges fine, I got a real Samsung charger, speakers work wifi works, over all great product. Will update if any problems occur."
38963,They did not repond well for my phone which stopped working. Very disappointing... :(
23454,"1 star because they went backward. What are you thinking? You have a hand up on apple and then you blow it and go backward by taking away the removable battery and also the SD card. All to add some money to your coffer. On top of this you cannot root the Verizon or AT&T Note5. I think some of these review are Fake, how could people praise this. My friend canceled his order because of this. You lose way more than you gain! Samsung I love your phones, the picture quality and touchwiz but I hate how you did this. This ones gonna bite back. You BLEW IT on this one! I went to post this same review on Verizon Wireless and they would not post it because it would hurt the sales. If they won't post mine they won't post other bad reviews also. What a scam! Amazon is excellent at letting the public post true reviews!"
14647,"In the description it said it would show signs of use Like minor scratches. And honestly, theirs not a single scratch. It's in perfect condition. And it came right on time. I'm in love with my mega 2. I highly recommend your search stops here. Two thumbs up for sure"
63992,"Alright. I'm going to give it to you straight. I did not like the service (From Huawei, Amazon did pretty good in giving me a refund). I bought the phone it had a delivery date. Didn't show up on delivery date and delivery date moved to another date (at least 3 days) didn't arrive on that either. Filed a refund and well I got it. Reordered the same phone. Came next day. I got it and tried setting it up. Then when it booted up the logo would appear the screen would dim to Black and the logo would appear again. Did this a couple of time until I tried hard resetting, I factory reset it. IT DID NOT WORK AT ALL. I sent it back and got a refund. From Amazon not from Huawei. I reordered it again. And as of right now same situation. It felt like they just resent the same broken phone twice. I honestly got nothing else to say besides avoid trying to buy the phone. If you do that's fine, if it doesn't work send it back and get a refund from Amazon. Also make sure the phone is new (mine was supposedly new, felt like a cheap old broken one). If you never get the phone get an Amazon associate to mark it as lost and get a refund. IDK why I had this many problems for a defective product? But I did and now y'all know. Try it out is all I can say but just be cautious. I tried the phone again today Nov,5th 2018 and I thought I got the problem figured but I guess I was wrong. It kept rebooting and wouldn't stop. Currently sending the note to get another refund"
14854,"I've had nothing but problems with this phone since day one! The screen rotation never really worked and then totally quit and now the phone constantly shuts off for no reason so I am missing texts and calls all of the time. I really wasn't asking for much just a big screen to surf the net and text with, that's all. I just ordered a new phone because this one is so unreliable, and there is no warranty and the phone isn't even a year old but I didn't find out about the lack of warranty until I started having problems. I will never buy a Samsung again."
7,"The 3599i is overall a nice phone, except that Nokia made its universal headset jack incompatible with most 2.5mm universal headsets (even their own). A phone call to tech support was required to find out that you need to buy a headset that plugs into the Pop-port accessory connector on the bottom of the phone. They ended up suggesting the HDB-5 headset."
51720,First they advertised unlocked phone but it is not unlocked. The phone is apparently a t mobile phone but with an att back and second the phone does not charge.
51703,I love this phone let me be clear it uses a micro sim card not a nano sim card. i owned the original Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) Express Prime. you guys need to get your description and answered question right because there are some things wrong. But i love the Express Prime 2 and it is allot better than the Samsung Galaxy J3 (2017) Express Prime
15708,The phone works great but I dI'd encounter a problem...the micro SD card reader slot is broke. I am really upset with this and didn't know if this is fixable.
23435,"Please, don't waste your money on this phone. My screen went out after having it for only five months; and when I contacted Samsung's customer service they basically implied theft. The phones battery doesn't come out, it constantly over heats, and there aren't any special perks. Plus, when I tried leaving a review about the phone on the Samsung website, they wouldn't even post it."
61463,Never owned an asus zenphone. and wow this phone is a killer. Love the design and the features it has built-in. Amazing battery life and awsome cameras with some high tech features. Not a single complaint. Cant wait for oreo update. Thanks asus.
22207,I received the phone in a timely manner. It came just as described. I Love it
9581,This phone is very large. The nice part about it is that it fits fine in my back pocket. The sound quality is good although it is odd to hold this monster up to your face. The battery lasts long. The camera is ok. Still waiting for some LTE in my area. Ugh!!
69012,"Had this phone for a month and all of a sudden today when I charge it, it won't hold a charge and the screen won't come on 😒"
23832,The phone arrived on a Friday and on Tuesday when I arrived at work the phone wouldn't turn on! After work I took the phone to my cellular service and they couldn't get it to turn on either. I had them hook up my old phone so I have a usable phone. I returned the phone and got my money back.
1391,"This Motorola phone is as described, new. The speaker phone is a priority and the quality on this phone is very good. Very satisfied with this phone and the seller. Updating this review after using phone a couple months. The record button is too easily activated and frequently the phone gets messed up and I have to take the battery out so it will work again. The seller replaced phone and it's working fine without the problems of the previous phone."
77263,"I was a little worried about buying this phone being that has the international version, but it has a 5000mah battery 64 gigs and 4 gigs of RAM so I wanted it, I called net10 to see if it would work on the AT&t network and they said it would so I received it. The first lady I talked to it had troubles getting it going, I talked to the supervisor and she got it working perfectly on the first sims spot. so just saying if net10 can get it to work on the AT&t network anybody should be able to get it working on a AT&t network I have no idea about T-Mobile. the phone seems to be working wonderfully it's very fast it has plenty of memory works good with a SD card, I have no problems with it and very happy that I got it."
76886,"Hasta el momento va bien todo , el lector de huellas va bien . Es muy bonito y las fotos de muy buena calidad"
45702,I travel to Thailand extensively and always carry 2 phones. I can now carry just the Apple iPhone6S unlocked and swap between ATT & Thailand 123 Call Simm chips. Make traveling much easier.
54936,"Love the look and feel, and it had me very happy for a few days. After those few days, the phone began to freeze when launching certain apps and would only be fixable by removing the battery. Also, the music application would often stutter the audio and need a reboot. The phone is veryyyy slow, like press a button and wait 3 seconds for a response slow. I can get past that though. One of my biggest issues is that I was trying to get away from the smart phone lifestyle, but it’s impossible without cutting communications with friends. A lot, if not majority of, my text messages would come in completely blank. Potentially something to do with iMessage, but I’m not positive. Very annoying either way."
63414,Phone had no faults wasn't disappointed just as described
15342,"Great phone, was exactly as listed. Unfortunately it will not receive on all of the bands I checked (3g and 4g EDGE). This is different from the information the seller gave me when I emailed. I am still giving it 4 stars, because the bands it does receive are the ones that are most frequently used (2g or voice and 4g LTE)."
80967,Came in a sealed box brand new no issues at all i am very happy with my purchase
71032,"OnePlus is an amazing phone. There might be a small issue with the battery, because you are charging and discharging your phone very quickly and doing so repeatedly over the course of many days. The battery might wear out very quickly."
2689,It is light and small. Easy to carry with a second phone. As I use it more I can update my review of the phone performance.
64761,Phone is awesome. But the seller is bad. Only sells phone with charger brick and USB. No headphones included. And sends it in a normal rectangular box with barely no protection.
3178,"When this phone first came out, I'm sure it'd be worth more stars. But as it functions with today's technology, it's lacking. It lags a lot between closing and opening apps. It hardly holds any pictures before you have to upgrade to an SD card. It really only serves as a back up phone in case of a break at this point. It is functional though, and you can easily survive with it."
28838,Purchased this for my younger brother and he seems to be enjoying it
32328,"I like it a lot, I recommend the phone for anyone who needs an upgrade. I had a s4 for years before getting a new phone. Camera quality is as expected from numerous resources. Game play is dope and crystal clear and videos seem better. If you want a great phone for a less price, this would be it. And the charger, is amazing. Charged my phone in minutes."
31464,"The battery doesn't last as long as I'd like, it usually does half way through the day if used normally, N nothing excessive. If used a lot with music and videos, itll die in several hours. But I think that's a lot of phones so I'm not too butthurt about it. A much needed upgrade from my S5 so I'm happy with it, especially the speed!"
64394,"Good phone , a little light but works fine. only bad thing is that doesn't have NFC , the rest works fine."
27642,"Great phone love it , thank you for the seller brand new, I will by 3 more if are in same shape thank you again ."
36110,Exelente equipo en muy buenas condiciones parece como nuevo
24877,"Product arrived on time, everything in package. The only problem my phone would shut off at 15-20%. I bought another battery I thought that fixed the problem but the prongs that's near battery are not connecting. I won't buy another one. I'll go in store to buy my next phone. Update I had to buy another phone less than a year because this phone keep coming up with issue."
23547,"I was a bit apprehensive at first from other reviews but I've been using it for about three weeks now and have not had one problem. There's some wear on the home button, but other than that, there's no scratches or dents. Its a lot more than I expected from a refurbished phone."
4362,I had a phone that the operation system crashed. I bought a new one just over a year ago and I think it just crashed because it won't finish starting up
36194,I bought this as a gift. It doesn't work at all. Hope seller will refund.
7907,"Love this phone. GPS locks in very quick. Battery life at end of day, after medium use is about 45%. I continuously check NYTimes (set to refresh every 30 mins), listen to Spotify occasionally, Use MyTracker, use the Stylus to scribble notes (which get synced to Evernote). Big user of Evernote app, the camera. Occasional Facebook check, About 10 or 15 Whatsapp texts and some Hangout, SMS texts... It's fun carrying this tablet around (just kidding. But, well, it's big). Great screen. I love the stylus... one of the reasons I got this. Had Galaxy S3 before this... and I liked the camera settings in that one better than this one. That camera had some scene modes this doesn't have. Oh... I also run a Weather widget continuously. Great battery life. Great screen. Good for Google doc reviews too."
18399,"After 1 week usage the phone turned off by itself and I couldn't turn it on. I was charging the device for like 8 hours and after that and I tried to turn it on and it was working. Than I decided to update the Android, it happened successfully. after I realize the front camera in the dark shows me some blue spot on the screen. Anybody who has the same problem, what can I do ? Next to that I didn't got any warranty paper just a box in that the device and the charger for the phone . Thank you for the help."
23870,"The phone came on time but it didn't have 4g capability. The back camera went out at times,I had to reset the phone. The charger adapter wasn't functioning a hundred percent."
58109,"I am really glad for this phone. Thumbs up, I recommend buying it. It’s worth buying"
23704,"The Note 1 pen worked great, don't know why Samsung had to mess it up with the pen on this phone. My wife and I both have this phone and before one year, both pens were messed up, couldn't get them out, they broke. If you don't want the pen, it works great, if you want the pen, forget it!"
2187,Will not allow me to send picture messages to anybody but like the phone.
29985,This phone has NO signal no matter where its used! 3 days past the return date or it'd be going back.
64706,"This was one of the best purchases I've ever made. Ive used this phone for 3 days without charging, the screen is huge and high quality, and it's a powerful device."
17618,The best phone ever better that Samsung just need to know how to use it
29366,My daughter loves her phone. Would use this seller again.
13801,Samsung Galaxy S5 G900V meet my expectation .The phone has many future options and a good quality camera.
22032,Can't get the pictures to lighten up and the phone constantly jumps out of camera mode. It also occasionally jumps out of other programs too.
23056,Quality and finish are as described. Phone works well.
81156,screen quality is low doesn’t correspond with pixels and density that is declared in description
36002,"I bought this phone in January and today is May 30, 2018. I know when you buy a refurbished phone you take a chance, but this has only been 5 months and the LCD has started leaking and blacking out my screen. Phone has not been dropped, just started off as a small dot on screen and has now taken over my screenNow I have to purchase another one. Of course it lasted just long enough to be out of return policy. I strongly recommend not purchasing this phone!!"
40929,Very happy with the product! Working fine without issues.
37799,"I used to have a Samsung Galaxy Core Prime, so I'll be honest in saying that really anything was probably going to be a step up. When I was looking for a new phone, I really wanted something with a nice camera. The Google Pixel XL certainly delivers. The camera is great for snapping selfies, or, if you're me, taking tons of photos of your dog. They look good in most lighting situations, but obviously will turn out way better in brighter light (such as natural light from the sun) rather than low light / dim lighting. Either way, I'm impressed with the crisp, detailed photos I can get and with this phone my dog just might become an Instagram celebrity. The only thing I don't necessarily like about the phone is that there is no SD card slot. I purchased the 35gb version just after Christmas (so late December/early January) and so far after nearly 7 months have not maxed out the memory. I imagine when I do it will be because of the thousands of high quality dog photos I've been taking (plus a handful of short videos), which I'll just move to a flashdrive or something. Photos are automatically backed up to a cloud if you so choose (which i believe is connected to your google drive??) but i honestly have no idea how to access that, so I'd rather save them externally myself. Overall the phone is responsive and easy to use, I love the camera and the fingerprint scanner is a nice touch that I never knew I needed. The battery usually lasts me about 2 - 2.5 days, but I tend to use my computer a whole lot more than I use my phone. How long it will last depends on how much you're using it, of course. I bought this product used from the seller ""TheGizmoTrader"" who I would recommend because their listings all have photos of the phone so you can see the amount of wear. The phone I picked was listed as ""very good"" quality and looks almost new, aside from a very thin hairline scratch on the screen which is almost unnoticeable. I also received the phone within a week of purchasing it, so I believe this seller is great at getting orders out in a timely manner. If you're on a budget and you want a nice phone, I recommend buying used. I can't even tell that the phone was used before me as it still runs just as well, and I have a case protecting it anyway so any minor scuffs on the body are covered. Overall I'm still so glad that I bought this phone and I would totally buy a Google phone in the future!"
49638,"Awesome, great sound. A great buy for my teenaged son."
5136,"I received my phone about a month ago but didn't activate it until two weeks later because I kept forgetting to go and switch my number to my new phone however now that I did don't see why I didn't do it sooner love the phone and everything about it ,it's fast , easy to use, and has alot of little extras that my old phone didn't have so thats why I say so far so good."
27050,This phone was bought and when I went to turn it on it asked me a google account which I don't have and I need it to get on
33821,"Really surprised about how much bang for the buck. Sony should advertise this, they are missing the boat. I use it on tracphone system and it far exceeds my expectations. If you doubt me compare xperia specs to high end others and you will see what I mean."
55669,Extremely disappointed !!! My phone stopped working because the seller did nor fully paid for the phone. T mobile blocked it due to bad IMEI.
56500,"Was a little hesitant when purchasing a refurbished phone but with the return policy and the low price, I thought I would give it a try. Received phone today and so far I am quite pleased. I looked it over closely and could not find a single mark or scratch. The battery seems to be doing well. It will take a little time before I know for sure. The only small flaw I found was with the pen. The tip is a little worn but still functional. If it needs to be replaced it's a cheap, easy fix. Overall I am very pleased with this purchase."
11645,"Purchased this phone 10 days ago, but the battery won't hold a charge. I contact customer service to rectify the problem and was told I would have to purchase a new battery. I don't know what Harry Potter Scam you running, but how is it fair for me to have purchased a phone with a defect battery and I'm responsible for purchasing a new battery?"
16608,Had mine note 3 stolen from me and wanted to buy a new one
49335,"The Ultra is a is first and foremost a camera phone, emphasis on “camera”. the 60 megapixel camera with LED flash on the back allows for vivid picture/video capturing and the 8 megapixel camera in the front captures great lighting yet slightly grainy images. the phone is an ample 6 inches making it one of the bigger phones out there, it is the epitome of a phablet. saying that it is surprisingly light and if you do not mind maneuvering the phone with both hands it is overall very user friendly. It packs a ton of contrast and brightness, a great upgrade from the 5.5 Xperia XA1 which is lightly more opaque. At 3 GB of RAM the phone does a good job at multi tasking apps, and it works just fine if you use various simple apps at a time, I have had no issue interchanging between Facebook, you tube, and looking up several things on google chrome that re directed me to other websites not counting your basic texting and calling. The phone has a micro SD and SIM card slot on the bottom side, and its slot cover is attached to the holder for the chip, allowing for more manageable insertion and extraction. Design-wise, the Ultra although obviously big, makes up for it in sleekness and weightlessness. it is as thin as the iPhone and surprisingly light at 6 ounces. Screen wise, the phone’s frame is almost unnoticeable on on left and right sides when held vertically and its upper and lower frame sections obviously wider to accommodate for the camera lens up top and command bar on the bottom. The command bar blends well into the the screen and has no actual home push button, which was a bit of an adjustment for me as I am used to the iPhone design. Horizontally held, the dimensions are very well designed, allowing for great dimension video watching and landscape document viewing. One of the big design faux pas of the Ultra is shape of its four corners. They are rounded vertically not horizontally which make for an edgy grasp that is uncomfortable when extending the thumb. However, I really liked the positioning and ease of push of the side buttons as they are placed along the upper middle of the right side, and more responsive than the buttons on the iPhone in my opinion. I also was pleasantly surprised with the shutter button as it allows for easy picture taking without having to unlock the phone; a feature that further highlights the camera as its piece de resistance. Material wise, the screen glass is easy to clean, scratch resistant and has been surprisingly durable after a few drops. However, the backside cover, although a matte style material, it is prone to absorbing oils , making it look greasy and dirty with every use. I also noticed that the back side sinks in slightly, which brings to light that the phone material is equivalent to its price in many respects. Installation was a bit of a hassle with my provider (Tmobile) as I could not transfer my old SIM card to this phone because it did not fit. Finally, the 2,620mAh battery uses the Qnovo Adaptor which is supposed to extend its life and performance, allowing for up to 13 hours of talk and last up to 28 in stand by. I found that after continuous use throughout the day without watching videos, the battery life is at around 25% at the end of the day without any charge or placing STAMINA MODE, not bad as far as battery life in my opinion. It uses the USB Type-C port, which I do not like as those ports are less common and I constantly loose my chargers I so I have found myself buying two replacement adaptors already. Overall, I was pleased with the function of the phone, specially the camera, and liked that although large, the phone made good adjustments to compensate. I must say although this is not a travel or female clothing pocket friendly phone, so the fact that carrying it is a hassle in itself diminishes its capacity of use."
62270,"I have the phone 8 month till now, it works perfectly. But somehow slow when open navigation, bluetooth and mobile data simultaneously. Otherwise perfect"
74574,"This phone DOES NOT have warranty if you live in the US. Make sure to verify the phone is compatible with your network. We have T Mobile/ATT. It is a LTE network. This phone will intermittently receive calls other times they go straight to voicemails. I missed half my calls. We had issues since we got the phone but by the time we spoke with Huawei and determined what the issue was, it was too late to return it. We have 2 other Huawei phones that are great, just dont buy this one. This was a waste of money"
21118,this phone is okay.. Im just not allowed to send mms messages to non-apple users and that sucks after that it is a great phone
40712,Phone came today in perfect condition! No scratches or anything! Comes with a charger. I was worried but it is certfied refurbished and in great condition! Shutter won't turn off >:(
44172,Would have gave five stars but BlueTooth gremlins plagued this S5. I don't blame seller as the IEEE Blue Tooth and WiFi standards cause interoperability issues between devices that are supposed to pair reliably but don't.
45077,Love my iPhone looks like new no scratches or dents.
2340,Good for the price. Lost my original phone and had to wait for 5 weeks but was happy to buy.
27394,"The phone was in great shape looked new, works good I'm satisfied.."
72756,Perfecto producto. Muy elegante y rapido en respuesta
55649,"The jump from a Windows Mobile phone to Android was necessary one, considering Microsoft's decision to abandon mobile computing. I had read too many good reviews of the Galaxy series of phones and found this seller with a reasonable price in a non-black color. I find I really like the Orchid Grey. I ordered a Patriot 256 GB microSD in addition and haven't looked back. I am very pleased with the phone and carry in a pouch around my neck which was used for the also 6"" form factor Nokia Lumia 1520 this Samsung phone is replacing. I really question the whole Locking/Unlocking requirements, but fortunately the Samsung phone has been taking OS updates successfully, so this seller is NOT misusing the ""Unlocked"" as a tease. I like the phone, great graphics, although many software writers do not accommodate the slightly narrower screen width in their rigid game field aspect ratios. >> I would buy from this seller again, should they have a similar good price for what I am looking for. No problems with the product that showed up nor the transaction/delivery. <<"
82318,Love it!...It does screen mirroring direct to samsung able tv's. Cameras ok. Dolby atmos make any headphones sound awsome. The seller also gave 2 free 128 mb class3 sd cards which was a supprise. Quick shipping as it arrived befor delivery date. To activate i took it into a wireless store where to my supprise they just threw in my existing sim and worked right away. Im also on Verizon!
1084,"User friendly. Great for what I need it for; email, internet, social media apps and ereading apps. Photos and videos come out great!"
60270,"A great smartphone, but a buggy messaging app due to an error of downloading or receiving mms occur after a security software update. It looks like Huaweii has abandoned the android pie update for the US variant. I had to return it for a full refund."
76487,Great phone but the price dropped $75.. 3days after I bought it.Amazon doesn't offer price protection Motorola won't help unless you buy direct. Live and learn.
34688,"I won't leave comments on the specifications of an iPhone SE, but on the condition of this particular refurbished phone. Mine had a few barely-noticeable scratches on the body, but there was no damage to any buttons or the screen. Once the software updated, it worked exactly like it was supposed to. The headphone and charging ports are also in immaculate condition. Both cameras work the way they're supposed to and the phone is just as fast as any other iPhone SE I've used. It came with a generic Lightning/USB cable and wall adapter. It doesn't come with Earpods but Earpods aren't great anyway. I am really happy with this purchase."
61694,"It's in perfect condition, not a single scratch, smudge, or dirt. Just a heads up for anyone who doesn't clear your voicemail, whenever you pop your sim inside you will get a notification for every single one lol."
16116,I bought this phone refurbished and the $50 price tag is low but for what I got it for being refurbished was crazy low in the cost. It works just fine for what I use it for and being that I got a refurbished phone they took it through all the testing and made sure it worked 100%. My phone works well and I have had no problems with it at all.
62299,"This is a very good phone for the money, probably the best budget phone on the market. Quality of build is very nice and it has lots of features. Screen resolution and brightness is excellent, and it also takes very good photos. To be honest; in terms of capabilities I do not understand why people plunk down $800 and more for a top of the line phone brand or model, because this phone is just as good. Maybe if you are a ""gamer"" a faster processor might pay off, but nevertheless, the quad-core processor in this phone is more than powerful enough for 90% of users, and then some. I was glad to see Lenovo brought back the magnetic compass sensor int his G6 phone, which they had dropped in the G4. Also, GSM function works perfect with high sensitivity, even with GLONASS. And ready for Galileo, if these Europeans ever get their act together. I also like the fact that this phone is both GSM and CDMA compatible, (quad band) which means you can use it for just about any provider, and any part of the world. I would have have liked dual-SIM capability though, it comes in handy when traveling overseas. I do not understand why this is always omitted for US marketed phones. But hat is about the only gripe I have."
18217,"Were supposed to get 2 sim cards access, discussed with amazon agent to reconfirm this was the case however when the cel was opened it only had acces for 1 sim card!"
39734,"The phone has worked really well and the battery life has been fairly decent. It's not a brand new battery by any means, but works well."
80953,"So far so good. That was first day review. But, I found it is a very poor phone. After four days it dropped onto the my wooden floor and no breakage and no scratch found. In fact the phone was protected by flip cover. But, display damaged. How come? My other phones dropped several times even on concrete floor. Never been damaged. I suspect during shipping any damage could be done that prompt after dropping from my hand. Because the phone was not securely shipped. The phone box was open as well. I suspect it's a duplicate phone ( not original). I contacted support. They said because of dropped it happened so they cannot do anything. The worst phone ever. Never buy. Seller also not recommended. I uploaded few photos. 1st one taken after opening the box right after from courier man. As you can see no protection, 2nd after dropping from my hand, 3rd display situation after dropping. Be careful. Don't buy anything from this seller."
74248,"Recien lo compre y debo decir que este teléfono es una maquina! Sus 4 gb de ram lo hace súper rápido y su batería dura bastante, soy programador de equipos Android y lo e probado con varias plataformas y este Android NO le debe envidiar nada a ningún otro teléfono, para su precio es mas de lo que yo esperaba."
44040,Had one before it went swimming. This is less costly than a new one from Verizon. Works great.
42037,"No real durability. Two days in and the screen broke while in a case. Not sure if it is the build quality of the phone or if during refurbishing a lesser product was used as a screen replacement. The phone itself is great, but who cares if the phone is super brittle"
43471,We set the phone up over the phone with Sprint (replacing a Sprint phone) but it just kept resetting and kept updating for days. Took it to Sprint and they started over but it would randomly shut off and restart. A huge bummer.
64435,"Huawei, your the real mvp.. My galaxy note 5 just got replaced and I don't think I'm looking back. Uderrated little beast great build and solid specs.. Bye bye Samsung hello Huawei."
79364,"I like the size , it has 3 cameras ,processor is fast , screen is big so we will se after a few months . will post again ."
35657,"The phone itself is great, the best phone I think I ever had but the charger came with the phone died in a week. I assume the problem is the with the cable, its connector to the phone seems to miss a pin which is sign of pretty bad quality, loosing it after only some charges."
22672,"No volume, can't talk or receive call without earphone. The battery life is bad. Charged full 100% at 7am by 12 noon it's gone."
8159,"For a use divice i will give a 5 start, there was not signe of use at all. Verry happy it come with all accesories, cant ask for more. The charge was not compactible with it but work on my others divices. Great deal here. Thanks."
53679,"Arrived on time. Looked brand new. Battery holds charge all day as one would hope. It was GSM unlocked, and worked flawlessly with TMobile SIM card. Just popped the card in, and it all worked without a hitch. I'd buy this again if I needed another SE.... which I don't. Because this one works fine."
17621,I am disappointed one of the them working well an the other one is not the screen have lines running tru it what am i supposed to do with it
78194,"It answers to our expectations. Price is still high, but it worths."
68765,I love this phone. I've never bought an unlocked phone before but I am happy I did.
49259,This phone is lightning fast and the size of the screen is amazing. Speaker is a little tinny and there is no fingerprint sensor. But a true bargain at the current price of approximately 260
49720,"Still very much in love with my Nokia 6. However, the charger has already developed a fault."
15144,Phone has all kinds of issues despite software update
32939,"I chose this one expecting a little bit more. I heard that the camera of this phone was good, but it is not as good as it could be. The best devices for great images are iPhones. Before this one I was using an iPhone 5S, so the difference is brutal. When charging, the phone turns so hot, and sometimes touchscreen doesn't work in certain zones. If you have an iPhone, believe me, this is going to be a disappointment. If you only need some basic functions, this phone works very well."
6880,"UPDATE (11/29/2014): Called and chatted with Moto five times over a period of 20 days, my replacement phone is still nowhere in sight. Different reasons were given. The last one is that I need to get another RMA and send in my credit card number again. Drop rating to 2 stars for inferior service. ORIGINAL: Cracks are showing up after 6 months of normal use. Cameras are not great. I really liked the phone. It is thin and it is fast. The plastic cover feels good. In fact, I dislike the cold and harsh feeling of aluminum used on my Apple products. The screen is reasonably bright and colorful. It is speedy and uses the stock Android. Not much bloatware. BUT, the side of the phone cover starts to crack in recent days. There are 6-7 cracks all over the side of the cover. The battery is getting shorter over time. Other than these, it has been a good phone. I need to get warranty service."
71860,"I bought this phone from Best Buy on sale and I freaking love it. I was using a Moto G5Plus and it started to get really Laggy. I heard of this phone earlier in the year when it came out and regretted not getting it. I'm glad I remedied that. It's snappy and everything loads fast. The camera is amazing for the price I paid. Low-light photos can be a little bit crap, otherwise the camera is good in all conditions. It receives updates regularly unlike my Moto phone. Also the Sony skin over the top of Android Oreo is just gorgeous. There are so many background options and ways to update the look of what you see on screen. Also incase anyone is wondering this Phone works on Verizon now! That was also the reason I did not buy it at first. I believe it only gets LTE service on Verizon but if you have AT&T or T-mobile you should get 2g'3g' and 4g in addition to LTE. I'd highly recommend it"
23725,Good battery life is the most impressive thing about this phone. Last two days with regular use.
76058,"I hate the curved screen. There is color shift around the edge, and the screen is always registering touches from just holding the phone. Otherwise the phone is fine, but too thin to hold without a case. I like the speed of the S10 over the S7, but the form factor of the S7 better. I liked the removable battery in the S5."
76136,Upon getting phone and plugging in to charge within 5 minutes it was burning hot.
7400,"The large display is nice, but the phone its self is very hard to carry. Easy to drop especially for someone with arthritis,"
64026,"In short, Every penny well spent, this phone have proven to be the real deal when it comes to considerate price for innovative technology. The phone has been working perfect from the time I have commenced using It to Now. For the price point it even packs a very great camera, 16mp and 2mp dual rear camera and a 16 mp front facing camera. Couldn't find a better phone than the Huawei p20 lite at this price point."
61038,I want to return for exchange. This unit won't let me charge with a cable. Gives me nothing but water sensor errors. It's never been anywhere near any water or moisture
7828,This phone sucks always says no service . I miss calls a lot because of it
76965,"I love this phone. The color is amazing (I got red). I'm using H2O wireless (AT&T out of allentown, pa) and it works great on the international version. I was worried about this but I have had no problems at all (your mileage may differ especially if you are in an area with limited or spotty coverage). The turbo charger is AMAZING! A 20 MINUTE charge gets you to 75% quickly and I feel I can get a good 2 days of moderate usage on a full charge. It has a nice heft so it feels quality. The screen is beautiful. It's a clean build with virtually stock android... no bloatware. I love the motoGestures. To put it on 'Do not disturb', I can simply set it face down. It just works. I haven't really used the camera, but if you watched any reviews, it is a bit more than adequate if not great. So, unless you are insta-famous... this is fine. I could not be happier with this phone. I was a micro-user (on a payperminute plan) using an AMAZON FIRE PHONE (remember those?), but due to a new job with a 911 center, I needed/wanted to upgrade and a major upgrade it was for me. The international phone for the g+ is also cheaper than the US G7... more bang and cheaper (but no warranty). I would happily recommend this phone to anyone. It really is pretty... and the color is awesome (not boring like all the other US phones. I watched a lot of youtube reviews so I knew what I was getting and they were all spot on. It's a great value phone with Oreo 9. How many other flagship phones don't have 9 yet?"
72795,"Huawei definitely make the best hardware , this one and the previous mate 10 are excellent phone , my main gripe is the software. There's a bunch of maybe apps and they throw in some others like Facebook which is annoying but given the storage isn't an issue. Main problem I found is if you're using Google service the native photo email and messaging app will get in the road where they will still act as defaults so to send a photo you need to go in to photo and send it from there instead of doing in the messages app , pure Android on these would be perfect The fingerprint reader can be hinky but the face recognition is quick although I'm not sure how secure it is . Bluetooth can be problematic but I've switched to a pixel phone and some of the connection problems still exist. Screen protectors can be a problem I've had them fall off when you drop the phone so it pays to have spares. Can't fault the camera but I did miss the dedicated black and white sensor that was on the 10. These are IMHO the best looking phones around but they are slippery in the hand so you end up covering them in plastic which is a shame"
21514,Received my phone it was wrapped in plastic like new. It did not come with headphones and the charger cord and adapter were not from apple but that wasn't a deal breaker. The phone started right up and as of today is still operating like new. Would definitely recommend to anyone who is looking for a new iPhone.
13137,Overall a good phone for the price. There is no way to get rid of unwanted menu icons and the phone call quality is not what I expect from Nokia but the phone is durable.
2476,BOUGHT THIS PHONE FOR MY MOMSO THAT WE COULD PLACE A SIMS CARD IN IT AND THAT WORKED GREAT. THE ONLY THING SHE DIDNOT LIKE WAS THAT THE SCREEN/TEXT WAS SO SMALL BUT SHE MAINLY USES JUST FOR CALLING SO THAT PART WORKS OKAY.
56515,"I was completely worried about purchasing a renewed unlocked phone. It came with Verizon still on the start up screen, but as soon as I put my AT&T sim card in, it switched right over. What a relief! Phone is in EXCELLENT condition. Charger is not Samsung, but that's ok. The S-Pen is brand name Samsung, and has some scratches on the end but I don't even care. The phone itself is gorgeous, and works perfectly ! Very satisfied with my purchase. I should also mention, there are no headphones either, but I still have the other pair from my other phone."
15922,"Its a great backup phone or for a first time Windows Phone user.. for the price I expected the performance to be slow but I stand corrected .. the Performance is pretty good. You will need a micro SD card though as it only has 4GB of storage. Windows Phone OS runs very smooth and the phone is compatible with Windows Phone 10!! The display is alright but its not very vivid with colors and its nothing like an iPhone display.. The phone is very comfortable in the hand. The camera is okay, it doesn't have a front facing camera or a flash. If you want a phone with a camera that takes HD video/ pictures this is not the phone. It is however a great phone for a new smartphone user and its pretty good for the price :)"
77734,Awesome for everyday use. Might be a little small to watch videos. Battery does not last long. Nice Cameras
71590,My unit arrived and looked to be brand new. Only thing I noticed was some small rub marks on the bottom back edge - probably from a case the previous user had. Other than that it's worked like a charm. Glad I gave the refurb route a try. Saved me plenty of money.
28765,"I love this smartphone, but there's always room for improvement."
196,Phone came with coupons from 2011-12 so phone is an older model. Not bad for $3.59
3623,Got an ATT phone despite the description saying that its factory unlocked. I need to send it but am traveling back to my country. This is so frustrating
12793,"I have had this phone for about 2 years and a couple other versions for the 2 or 3 years before that. I love this phone and the windows interface. I drop it every other day,and doesn't break. Super simple to use with the ability to put all the tiles I need on the face of the phone so I don't have to think about what I need and where to find it on a super small screen with super small icons like other phones. The photo to text, send contact to text is great. I regularly use a blue tooth and periodically use it as a hot point, and both work great. The camera was better than expected, and the lack of a flash wasn't as critical as I thought as it does well in low light. I don't take advantage of cortana, but works fine. The Here Map GPS app that comes with the phone works fine. The only negative is that I need a couple apps for my job that are only on android or iphone, and are not available on the microsoft store. The lack of apps will be the only reason I would switch from this phone after some version of it for around 5 years. I love it."
78038,Purchased this S10+ for my wife's birthday. She was so pleased... great value and another terrific Samsung Galaxy product.
30536,"Had issues with delivery through FedEx. They wouldnt leave it at my house so I waited 3 days to pick it up.. got it and seemed ok until I put my sim in and it wouldnt connect to ATT network. I called ATT to try to activate it but the employee said the IMEI had been marked as blacklisted, stolen, and unpaid so they cant unlock it etc. This has been a huge waste of time and energy and I should have listened to my instincts to NOT buy a phone on Amazon. I reported this seller and hope no one else has to go through this"
12564,"it is broken.. I bought an cellphone with screen problem, tactil its ok, but the image turn off and on quickly... I live in Venezuela and I don't have how to sending back for guarantee. I send a e-mail but no response. I hope others cellphone have been better."
19765,Worst ever. Got my package with only a note inside and not the item.
13784,"Bought this phone as a gift, can't really make too many comments other than the phone works as described by the seller."
3310,The phone keeps losing it's signal. We probably should have purchased a remanufactured instead of a used one.
72747,"I need it's business apps, which is why I bought it. The camera and other apps are great (I deleted the games - I don't play games on my cell), but they aren't really important for me. Battery life is fantastic which allows me to use this phone and computer almost all day and NEVER need a charge. For business, this is great!"
49378,"Even though this was advertised as an unlocked phone, it was not. It would not work with any local provider or even Verizon. There may be an exception through other companies, but for an ""unlocked"" phone, it certainly didn't seem like it. It's not as hassle free as you would expect from the description. It does make a nice PDA or mp3 player, though. If you're looking for a phone to use with your provider however, make sure it'll even work in the first place. otherwise, just go through your provider in question."
26581,"I love how quick this phone is, everything seems to flow pretty smooth. The camera is awesome, however the turbo 2 has a lot of charging issues. Mine took 15 hours to charge to 100%. Unfortunately I had to return it."
70133,im very upset i bought for my wife bithday then i set up everyhting finally its not working they keep asking me the screen lock passworkd which i never know
58467,My data wouldnt connect but my text and call would. They said it's the phone not the plan. Never again
22284,"This is an excellent phone. It is very durable, nice design and user friendly. I had the S5 Active that was great and when I got this S6 Active, they are miles apart. There is a better operating system and after a few software updates, it is just as good as the S7 Active. The only downside between the S7 Active and the S6 Active is the S7 has a speaker in the front and it gives you better sound...naturally. Other than that, this thing is a work horse! I have bought several more S6 Actives for the different lines I have with AT&T and for the rest of the family."
40192,"Phone looked brand new. clean and shiny. have only used for 4 days, but everything seems to work like a charm. price was excellent!"
77009,"I have no complaints, really. Motorola has done very well by combining a slick design with a reliable phone."
25073,Only defect I found was the notification LED. Apparently it's been an issue for quite some time but OnePlus still hasn't addressed this small but annoying issue. Apart from that I loved the phone... till it got stolen... >:(
53499,"It's refurbished but you would never know it's screen and everything was just perfect no scratches no scuffs and it came with a real Apple charger and headphones .Ordered from “BREED” is a leading seller based out of Miami, FL First thing I did was sign in with my Apple ID and password And set it up as a new device . Don't use Touch ID or passcode , what a silly waste of time, When I turn on my phone i want to get right to business, I don't want to waste my time by pushing buttons And stuff. Then I turned up the brightness and enlarged the text size Then I did an iOS update to 12.1.1 Then changed a kazillion settings to get it where I wanted it Like screen timeout ,Sounds and notifications and stuff, Maybe it's because I am so used to Android phones that i customizing it the way I like. It automatically downloaded all my stuff from my iPad mini4 , photos and pictures and Stuff from iCloud . I got the 32GB model and I still got 25gb left free to use. I bought 50 GB of iCloud storage for $0.99 a month well worth it . I have a Moto X 4th generation and a Huawei Honor 5X unlocked smartphones,and a bunch of Blu Studio phones in drawers “junk drawers “. And this “iPhone se “ is just as fast as all of them . Popped in my nano SIM card from US Mobile out of my Honor 5x phone and started making phone calls right away “beautiful “ , No settings or anything that had to be adjusted. Battery seems great so far playing videos and everything, screen at full brightness Update later . ( Day one ) So far very happy with this purchase will update later ."
55068,TRUST ME!! Then again I'm 75 yo & after further review I'm changing my 1 star rating with some reservation to 2 stars. Guess what? I still like it! :-)
31127,The picture shows an AT&T phone. I was given a Verizon phone. I want AT&T phone. I haven't tried the phone yet. I hope it works.
24408,I love this phone! This seller even directly contacted me by phone to be sure that I was satisfied with my purchase.
32092,Ordered this phone with the understanding that it was a GSM (Cricket) compatible phone. After activating it I discovered that it is actually a refurbished Sprint phone and works on CDMA. This means I can't get any phone calls to go through. I have had my service provider trouble shoot it to no end and will probably have to return the phone. Phone condition was otherwise good for the price. The body is in good condition and the only signs of use are on the home button where you can see two large scratches.
36238,Great company. Good phone. I will buy another one for my family.
43476,Purchased phone and tried to get it setup at a Sprint store and was informed that the phone was tampered with and is NOT compatible with the Sprint network.
18386,"We've had a land line with CenturyLink for 13 years. Over the last 5 years it's worked about 75% of the time. I don't really like cell phones, but enough is enough. My wife has a similar Samsung Galaxy, so I got this one, called AT&T, They over- nighted the SIM, plugged it in and I'm talking. So far the battery seems to last forever. If you have big fingers a stylus is necessary. I would recommend this phone for anyone that doesn't have to have the biggest and latest."
69246,"Great value!!! 1. Two sim cards that can use simultaneously, conveniently and smoothly (especially you need to travel abroad frequently, that would be definitely a Must product with you). 2. Durable battery (only need to charge once a time per day. I am a heavy user in online stuff). 3. To some extent, the new Android one system is quite comparable to iPhone. 4. Delivered with a clear plastic phone cover (that is so thoughtful!). p.s. the only minor cons is that there is no earphone coming along with the phone set."
54837,I love the size and the physical number buttons. Phone was easy enough to figure out. There are limited functions and one that I miss is the option to increase the font size. Otherwise the phone works great as a basic cell phone to answer and make phone calls.
44480,"I recently purchased this Samsung Galaxy s5 as a replacement for an older 'basic' phone that will soon not work on the new Verizon network after the first of next year. As I already owned one Galaxy s5 and was very happy with its performance I thought I would buy another. This phone so far has been great. The condition was as new as if I had gotten it out of a new Box and it was up to date software wise also. I put it on my Verizon account and it seems to work very well. It does come with a charger and cable (Side note- the cable is for charging only - not data transfer, but that really isn't an issue with the phone and still well worth the price) I did talk to the seller about the cable issue and they were great to deal with and I would buy another phone from them if the need arises. So far the phone works well with wifi, and my network. the speaker on the phone works great for calls as well as the microphone - overall it is a great product so far!."
68915,"This was to be an UNLOCKED phone and when I tried to get it set up with Verizon-I wasn't allowed. I was told it had to be AT&T. I have to go outside to both make and receive a call and no text unless I am outside. How do I return this phone, due to it is not useful."
56598,"I've had this phone for almost a year at this point, and it's basically unchanged from when I got it. It's fast, it's dependable. Well worth the cost."
17824,Being honest I'm having a ton of problems with this phone but the quality is good but not as I expected it is cheap for the quality but I wouldn't buy another one
71861,"The phone works as a phone OK, but the camera is buggy! The camera will over heat in 4K video and shut off. The camera will error out in HD video when pushing the record button 1 out o 5 times. I have missed important shots. The HD video camera will not stay focused well in many situations."
55071,Probably a nice phone but with the upgrade to 4g by the cellular companies the phone could not reliably connect and make calls. Had to return it.
73523,It didn’t come in it’s box it was wrapped in paper and no headphones I still haven’t tried connecting it to my server but I’m not happy with my purchase and it had a scratch on the back so it’s not new I’ll keep ya updated It's working fine good phone I will recommend
13684,"This phone is exactly what I wanted. Arrived on time, perfect."
42463,"First off it is on Prime but it took 6 days to arrive which isn't very prime so we didn't start off very good, I bought this phone to use on the Straight Talk network so I needed an unlocked phone, it was advertised as ""unlocked"" but didn't say anything about needing a SIM card so I was proactive and ordered a Straight Talk SIM card just to be safe and that was a good thing as the phone didn't ship with a SIM card. After spending an Hour and twenty minutes on the phone with Straight Talk trying to activate the phone I found out that this phone is NOT unlocked for use so this phone will NOT work on Straight Talk!"
53775,"Bought this used for $270 on Amazon. Owned the phone for less than a week but I'm very impressed. (Probably new-toy syndrome.) Too easy to set up with Ting... just dropped a 128GB microSD card and the SIM card into it. Initial setup was, as always, easy with Android. I flashed Android Pie onto it with no issues, although I had to do it with ODIN as opposed to Smart Switch or Kies because I found out Samsung disabled this feature from both programs (server-side, so older versions will not work). It is physically a very sleek phone. It also feels very sleek... and slippery, and a huge fingerprint magnet. After I cleaned off my grubby paw prints, I slapped a case onto it. The screen itself is rather large and very generous with space. I have smaller hands but I can still comfortably (barely) use gesture typing with just my thumb. I am not a stylus user but trying... the stylus fits neatly into its slot at the bottom right of the phone. The phone's performance is... well, brand new. I can't get it to lag (yet). I'm not a super power user and like to keep things simple, so I haven't tested any crazy 3D gaming yet. (I've included my app list below, just to give you an idea of what I run on this thing.) It's nice to finally have a phone that keeps up with me. The camera is beautiful so far. I haven't used it as much as I want to yet but I have faith this will be better than my broken camera on my S7 Edge. Plenty of options in the app... nice, sharp, and colorful! Call quality seems fine... not tinny, not terrible, good to go. Network connectivity to WiFi is as fast as any of my laptops. Haven't tested tethering or anything like that yet. More to follow as I play around with it! - - Gmail - Disa - Hangouts - WhatsApp - Google Maps - Here WeGo - Adobe Lightroom - GoPro - Google Photos - SJCAM - Google Chrome - Netguard - Tasker - Timely - Aldiko Classic - Amazon Kindle - Amazon Music - Dropbox - Duolingo - YouTube UPDATE 20190906: Still pretty happy with the phone. Delved into VR use... it is pretty nice considering the battery drain while using it isn't as bad as my Galaxy Edge S7, plus it is fun to use! (Don't bother with the 2016 version of the Samsung Gear... it will mar any screen protectors and it is a super-tight fit with the connector AND the other side.) No lag so far with what I've used for Oculus Apps. One thing that drives me nuts is that I tend to take unintentional screenshots by just trying to hit the Power button or trying to lower the volume but reaching a bit too low on the left side. Pretty long battery life. Lasts me a full day and has more than 30% left with my normal use."
79765,"Great phone! Had a little trouble getting it activated, but it works great for the price. I'd definitely recommend."
59852,"Great phone, less expensive than getting a replacement phone thru carriers insurance plan."
5266,"Nice little smaller than expected, other than that great phone, great price, new in original box, lil disappointed.......in the size."
50778,"Extremely good, reliable phone. System updated to Android 9 (Pie) automatically and have lots of space for all of the apps I have.I do have far too many but love tinkering! All of the apps work well. I do miss having a dual SIM phone, nowhere to keep my other SIM. The absence of an SD card slot has not been missed as the memory appears adequate. Battery life is very good- especially with the new 'dark' mode. The phone is meeting all of my expectations of a smartphone so far!"
2990,"I'd like to start by saying this phone should get four stars. But I read a lot of possibly unfair 1 star reviews here and wanted to offset that a little. This being my first smart phone I was incredibly excited and did a lot of research. Becuase of budget I limited myself to what Verizon offered for free with a 2-year contract. And, to be honest, I think this is probably the best Android phone through Verizon for the money right now. (Of course I could be wrong) Overall, the phone is great. I love the large bright display. Reception is great in my area. I have the smallest data plan so I limit most of my online activities ot WiFi. But when I used the 4G, it seemed fast enough to do what I need to do. I think this is a great little phone. Now here is what I wish I had known before purchasing the phone. It's an 8GB phone. But what they may not tell you in the store or is listed in the very non-specific small print is that about 3.5 GB of that 8GB is already used and cannot be reclaimed. From basic after-purchase research I guess it's from the OS, reserved space for future updates and 'bloatware'. (apps that come with the phone... and in the case of Android / Verizon, cannot be uninstalled). So after purchase you really get about 4 GB of storage for apps. Just be sure to get a microSD card and point your pictures / video to it and I think the average user will be fine with the remaining space. I tend to get app happy on my Android tablet. I'm just being a little more conscious of apps and space with my new phone., I look at it like this, I can tolerate having what is actually a 4GB phone and I can tolerate the bloatware for a really nice phone that was basically free. The good news for us Android users is that we have the micro SD slot where you can store your pictures, movies and songs. And we don't have to deal with iTunes. (the main reason I did not choose an iPhone) So bottom line for me is that I'm okay with those compromises. I would recommend this phone. Just know going in that you'll have about 1/2 as much space as advertised and a lot of pre-installed apps that you may not use and cannot remove."
35550,This phone was everything I hoped for... it's a really great buy
80455,Teléfono de uso Basico de gama baja con buen rendimiento y bajo costo
6544,I was very dissapointed because the phone was advertised as UNLOCKED but was actually a LOCKED AT&T phone ! I had to change my cell phone carrier to AT&T to get it unlocked ! The phone is working OK now although the Motorola design is more difficult to use than other phones I have used !
44938,"This phone got a software glitch 5 days after the warranty was up..... hmmm!!! Pictures were not great either, wish I had returned it when I first got it. Phone is unusable, xperia companion and cell ohone repair man unable to get the phone back in working order."
42031,"I ordered my phone, got it, was happy. It's having issues connecting to my Internet though. Like I'll watch a YouTube video on my S5, and it'll be fine and the Internet works fine. But on the S7 I received, the Internet keeps disconnecting, yet everything else works. It's not booting my WiFi connection (like the network I'm connected to), but doesn't seem to want to use the Internet or something. Basically, I'm connected to a router but the phone keeps randomly telling me there's no network connection, and I have to keep turning the WiFi off and back on for the phone. Routers fine."
22816,After having to send the 1st one back due to it not charging at all. I received one that has a scratch on the screen and a full battery only last 2-3 hours. Due to my current phone completely dying on me I had not choice but to keep it at this point. I guess Im not disappointed in the phone itself just the supplier!
57579,"Came As Expected, Minor Scratches but nothing serious . Overall Satisfied With Product"
47979,"I am angry I have been in love with the Galaxy 8+ forever and I finally was able too purchase two of them one for my Son as a graduation gift and one for myself Well I am do disappointed the phone my phone of course has problems keyboard sticking and will only clear after a restart of the phone, duration time doesn't work on five minutes or ten minutes and some other things, like really this is supposed too be the Tops of Androids I am so Sad I called Samsung and the could see the phone had issues they did the trouble shooting and had me also do a process of course it didn't work so I am over the explosion of the Galaxy 8+ and one other thing it's a problem with the Samsung wireless charger it sits on the charger for 30 minutes or so and barely charged 10% like it's nothing special about this phone but the Over Pricing had I just gotten the Best Product I paid too get I would walk tall with But it's mot right too take that hard earned Money and Give Me an INFERIOR PRODUCT/ jenifferfoster8@gmail.com"
82608,"The phone looks good and has on paper has a great feature set, I found though that after about a month of usage the phone would freeze up every now and then rendering the fingerprint scanner inoperable and I'd have to use the pattern or face unlock. Outdoor visibility in direct sunlight isn't great, and when I manually boost up the brightness to compensate it overheats (hot weather though) The camera app struggles with videos stuttering on the first shot, have to then stop recording and start another one to get it stutter free, Google Camera works fine mostly. All together a decent phone for the price but mileage may vary for different users."
37688,"I BOUGHT THIS ITEM WITH A LOT OF GOOD EXPECTATION. BUT SO DISAPPOINTED WHEN VARIOUS TIMES I COULD NOT TURN IT ON...ALSO, I CHARGED IT ONE NIGHT WITH THE POWER OFF. THE FOLLOWING MORNING, THE PHONE WAS NOT CHARGED."
50874,I just wish that it didn't randomly shut off once in a blue moon
69566,"When we opened the package, there was nothing in the box except for the plug for the charger. No cord, just the plug. AND NO PHONE! Unbelievable. We immediately ordered a replacement. Guess what? It was locked! LOCKED! Terrible experience! I would have given a zero rating if permitted!"
74518,I needed a new phone and was between this phone and the samsung galaxy 9 or 10. This was cheaper than both and I love how friendly the user interface is. Google really did great on this device not to mention the camera is absolutely fabulous (rated the #1 camera phone overall by multiple reputable tech sites). I have always been hesitant to buy refurbished but this phone came on time and looks brand new. Battery life has been strong and it came with its accessories. Would recommend.
76099,I don't live on my phone and I have to say this has been the best phone I have ever had. Battery lasts 3 days and it is very easy to use. Love it!
55618,"We never buy new phones due to the outrageous expense. This Galaxy 7 was priced right. Unfortunately, we learned that not all ""unlocked"" phones are alike. This was a Verizon phone and we use AT&T as a carrier. As a result, we still get unwanted ads from Verizon. This is not the fault of the seller but should be pointed out at time of sale. The phone also did not come completely set to factory settings. It still had 3 previous profiles. This required a lot of back and forth with the seller to finally get the most recent Android update. A certain process is necessary for this and no documentation came with the phone. However, the seller was very responsive and was kind enough to give us a credit for our trouble. Overall, we are very pleased with the phone and with the seller."
34738,"The phones might be OK, but they came with the cheapest USB charger and cable I have ever seen. Plus they did not come with earphones. Yes, they are $ 40 cheaper, but you must deduct the $29.- earphones, so you are saving just $11.-, and then you're stuck with cheap chargers and kink prone cables. Never again!"
66884,excelente teléfono. Nada que envidiar a los gama alta
39846,It didn't meet my expectation. The charger is defected whenever I plug the charger it breaks and it is so annoying. I really don't like the charger. Overall the phone is ok
21470,Slowest piece of tech I have ever owned. Wouldn’t recommend to anyone to buy this product
12449,"The Nokia 635 is the perfect smart phone, and the price is certainly right. Not too large. Fits easily in my purse or pocket. Very user friendly. Love Windows software. Tons of apps. Great camera (although it doesn't have a ""selfie"" camera). This phone IS compatible with AT&T data software, It is 4G LTE with WI-FI and Data. Also will work in Europe and other foreign countries."
12356,"I have used it for 3 months. I have to say this phone is amazing. I went tubing once and I basically swam with this phone soaked in water for about an hour and it is still perfectly usable after that. Also it's step counter and heart rate monitor is amazing. And of course it does everything an android phone should do and is very fast. The size is also perfect for pocket, basically the biggest it can allow without causing discomfort. At first I thought the mechanical keys might be uncomfortable, but turns out I like it more than virtual keys. And after having this phone, because of its big screen, I transferred many things I did on ipad like playing games, watching videos, reading books to this phone, and it does a better job. After all, it is quite inconvenient to take a full size ipad into the toilet at work, right."
72674,"No manual, no adapter cord. Bare phone and charger. But, it did arrive roughly when they said it would, and unlike Fry's, they did not mark it backorderd after accepting my order."
56620,I cannot hear from the phone without using headphone not sure I’d phone is still under warranty
37042,I received this phone yesterday. Took it to the Verizon Corporate store today and was advised that this model is no longer compatible with Verizon.
32525,"Phone works fine, comes with minor scratches on the camera. Software version is Marshmallow. Cannot root as usual. Came pre-unlocked."
78652,"The phone didn't come in an apple box, but the box that it came in was very secure. It came with a charger and a SIM card tool. I have Verizon. I was able to take the sim out of my old iPhone and put it in my new iPhone, that simple no calls needed to Verizon. There was not a single scratch on this phone. It was as it it wasn't even used. The battery life lasts me about 1.5 days, but I'm a pretty heavy user. There are no issues with sound, the ports, or wifi. Such a great deal for such a great phone."
45814,"I was buying 64gb iPhone 6s but they sent me 16gb iPhone 6s which is not good , I am sending back the phone"
48881,literally the best phone in the 100$-200$ price bracket.
33027,"Phone runs hot if you use the gps , also you photos do not stay in they own albums so they are all mixed together, battery life is horrible , camera is average at best , apps do not run properly. Would not buy again"
40130,I went into this purchase very skeptical and with very low expectations of the condition that the phone would be in when it arrived. I purchased this phone as a replacement for my sons 5c so the price point really lured me in to give it a try. The phone arrived one day early with decent packaging. Opened it up and plugged it in and the phone booted right up just like it should after a phone has been whipped clean. The only blemish I could find was on the back of the phone one small dent but I assume that could have taken place being in someone’s back pocket while sitting down. All the camera functions worked along with the speakerphone. Only thing I could find wrong with it was the battery health was at 73% and that was to be expected on a phone of its age. I’ll be making another purchase like this down the road again.
56904,"It is amazing the difference. I have had a Note 4 for the past four years, and love that phone. When I got my Note 4, I was upgrading from a Note 2, and while there was a difference and improvement, I didn't notice anything dramatic. The difference between the Note 4 and this Note 8 is impressive. First, the speed it amazing. Sometimes I feel like the phone is too fast for the apps or the browser I am using. I will try to pull up pages, and still expect them to open at the same speed they did on my old phone, but things open up the second I hit enter. Second, the brightness of the screen is amazing. I don't have it set on the highest HD quality, to be honest I couldn't tell much of difference. I know there are 4k videos you can download where the image quality will be noticeably different, but for most apps and websites that don't put out their information in that high of a level of clarity, it's pointless. Finally, and one little cool feature that I haven't used in a long time, this phone has an FM receiver in it. I haven't listened to an FM radio in forever, but the gym I go to still uses it for broadcasting the TV sound when you are running. For years I have just had to read the subtitles and listen to music, but now with this, and a free app called NextRadio, I can tune in and watch some television while I run. I would highly recommend this phone to anyone looking for a large phablet type device. For any of you concerned about buying a refurbished phone, which I was, don't be. I would never have known this phone was refurbished if they hadn't told me. The box, while basic, came with the phone and one charging cable. While you don't get all of the bonuses that come with the new phone, you are paying hundreds of dollars less."
1192,"have made the switch from an android(galaxy ace 5830) to windows phone and have no regrets. the screen is large and crystal clear. the UI is clean, simple and runs flawlessly. web browsing is fast. moving between web pages, apps, calls, text is so smooth. the only thing i miss about my android is SwiftKey app! call quality and speaker volume are very good. it really needs some king of case because it is very light and slick. the only reason i gave a 4 instead of a 5 is due to the fact i can't send mms. this is because i use a straight talk sim for att. it does not allow mms on older windows phone. excellent value. not a huge issue for me as there are many other ways to share media. i had my android samsung for 1 year and current samsung focus for a week. it is a learning experience and i am getting to like it more each day. battery is longer lasting than my galaxy ace. just wanted to add that amazon has been fantastic. i initially recieved the wrong item from seller. amazon customer service had the correct phone sent out in 2 days and a refund credit given immediately. service above and beyond."
52653,"It works wonderfully, it does have small ware and tare on a couple of the corners and was a little dirty (just around the edges of the phone) but the screen and the back of the phone look in perfect condition. The batter life isn't the best but that was expected, been using it all week and it hasn't disappointed me one bit."
80589,Package was in very poor condition and item seemed to have skready been opened and used.
16007,was delivered in timely manner and was exactly as described was easy. To activate. And use. I would. Definitely recommend this and the website to all of my friends and family
66690,This phone is everything I expected. It's performance is great quick no lag. Service is great not lost in signal dual SIM usage data usage fine.
15016,"My son loves it. He is a nokia guy, prefers windows to apple. His phone was dropped on the stone path so he needed a new one. He says the camera is amazing."
35806,"I was very excited, it’s just one problem there a scratch On the home button. But I can work with it"
54478,This phone completely locked up and died after only 2 months.
1821,"Phone has good range. Was not new as advertised on web site, but is in good shape."
27506,Dislike the fact it shuts off all the time then either says it’s dead most the time or once in a while I could turn back on right away !! Smh now I hope it’s just the batterie and not the phone it self so I have to get it fixed
61220,"Product arrived in excellent cosmetic shape for a refurb. Only a minor small scratch on the side. However, the microphone didn't work rendering the device useless. What made matters worse is I had purchased a case and accessories, which I had to return as well. A real hassle, however seller quickly approved a refund."
42973,"the cell phone is very good, but the late delivery almost makes me miss the flight."
290,"Arrived quickly, charged quickly, added to Cell phone account easily and without and hassles. Great product!"
62234,It’s having technical issues. Touch screen and keypad seems to have a mind of its on.
18626,"Really like the Camera it's great. It's download capability is very fast, overall it's a great smartphone."
3503,"my wife got this phone a couple of weeks ago because her friend had just picked it up. they both have been having trouble with this phone, as of today, this will be the 10th time i had to take out the battery to reset phone. First day no one received texts, remove battery. Next receiving double or triple text, remove battery. Now phone is frozen, remove battery. we have not added any apps to the phone, we have updated the phone(software) since. not worth the headache."
4929,I have this phone for about 2 months and the baterry is running out very fast something around 3 hours.
4282,its slow not sure why . my other one was twice as fast .I'm am disappointed in the performance if this phone
40824,Bought for my 13 y/o daughter. Very good first phone. Only advice is to buy a GOOD protector for it (Defender/Otter Box).
3247,"PROS: 4.3"" screen size Motorola Smart Actions (way cool) Processor Phone build/design (e.g. DuPont Kevlar® fiber, Corning® Gorilla® Glass, and a water repellent nano-coating.) Overall size Battery life Speaker location Microphone location Removable storage (Micro SD) Stripped down UI Quick upgrades to Android software (now that Google is in charge) CONS: Notification light (not big or bright enough) Back camera (takes poor pictures esp. with flash) Front camera (only .3 megapixels) Screen resolution (no HD) RAM (need 2GB min.)"
78250,This phone is smaller than the S8+ but has about the same screen size. It feels lighter and earlier to hold in my hands.
28748,This phone never worked. Seller won't take it back. I bought a worthless phone for a lot of money. Never ever again this seller.
74517,"Fabulous camera, easy to use keyboard, the settings are extremely user friendly. If you are a fan of Google, then this is the phone for you. If you don't use Google for as much, then I would recommend looking at a different phone since Google is integrated into nearly everything on this phone systemm."
30802,I love this phone. I came in perfect condition - not a scratch to be found and works perfectly. Thank you!
6883,"Do not buy this unlocked version. You can get the Verizon Developer Edition with 32GB from Motorola for $649. Or the 16GB version from Verizon for $199 (plus 30% off with coupon code verizon30). My review: OK, so you got this far to look at reviews. I have had this phone for 4 days and think it is an excellent phone. Some background; previous phones are Galaxy S3 and iPhone 4s. I researched and looked in detail at the Galaxy S4, Droid Maxx, HTC One, iPhone 5s and LG G2. I ended up with this phone because of the size and still has an excellent 4.7"" display, the built quality and feel in the hand, excellent battery life, stock Android with some really useful add on features. After being very frustrated with the battery life and lag on the S3 I decided it was time to upgrade. All the phones I mentioned are good phones. They are all noticeable larger than the Moto X. With the exception of the 5s which has a 4"" screen which I feel is just too small. The Moto X has better battery life than all but the Droid Maxx and LG G2. I get a day and a half with average usage. This varies for everyone. The Verizon version of the G2 is not that good because they redesigned the rear buttons in order to put in wireless charging. This along with the LG UI and not being sure how the LG will do in the market and provide timely updates removed it off my list. And with my demand for a long battery life that eliminated all the others except the Droid Maxx. The Maxx and X are very similar phones. The Maxx does have the best battery life but it is larger and heavier with the 5"" screen and extended battery. If you are fine with that or prefer the larger screen that may be the way to go. I felt the size and feel of the Moto X was better for me in comparison so I choose the Moto X. The negatives of the Moto X are that it is only available with 16GB at this time and it is sealed so you cannot add not add an SD card or change the battery. The Maxx is also sealed but has 32GB. This was not a deal breaker for me. My plan was that if I was disappointed with the Moto X battery I would exchange (14 days) for the Maxx. So far I have been very impressed with the battery life. I have read some reviews that have complained about the call quality and the camera quality. I have not had issues with either. There is also an update to the camera software that will fix some of the issues that people complained about. The call quality and speakerphone have been good for me. It does have an excellent speaker. Maybe not as good as the HTC One but plenty good. The additional features include the active notifications (screen blinks every 5 seconds to show notifications, Motorola Assist (detects when you are driving and changes settings accordingly), Motorola connect (you can see you calls and texts from your computer and respond), and hands free Google Now (you can access Google Now hands free and it will do various functions like calls, calendar events and Google searches). You can read more about these functions on the various reviews of the Moto X and new Droids. Hope this was helpful and feel free to ask any questions. Thx. An update (10-15-13): Still very happy with phone and the battery has been great and it charges quickly. I did notice that the screen can be difficult to see in sunlight. The auto brightness does not adjust well when outside, you will need to go into setting and turn up the brightness. Not a deal breaker for me. I was also going to recommend the case I got from Amazon but it is no longer on Amazon. It is nice if you want a very thin case with a good grip (Areser Ultra Thin Slim Fit Quicksand Hard Case + Free Stylus Pen for Moto X Phone (Sold by Areser Trade))."
8164,I loved this phone and can’t wait to get another one
5584,"I was upgrading from another Samsung device with a single core processor and Android 2.3. The S4 has really blown me away and convinced me I should upgrade more often. The difference in speed of the apps is just something that you'll have to see for yourself. The phone is large with a beautiful screen, and while the size takes a little getting used to, after a couple of weeks now I've adjusted. It still fits in my shirt pocket and it's very light and thin. This thing is loaded with features, powerful hardware that can run any Android app with blazing speed, and very well designed Samsung apps that enhance and ease the use of the phone and even your own data and networks. Samsung includes an app that lets you access and share data across all your devices that's very useful and serves a real use for those using Android devices on Windows networks. I'm not sure if the S4 is considered a 'phablet' but it should be... I was able to install Office 365 Mobile and it's actually usable. Typing on this phone isn't nearly as challenging as the smaller phones. I won't be writing any novels on it but I can open and edit documents as needed, and forward them to wherever I want, or save them to my Windows network storage. Google has amazing document and spreadsheet capabilities built-in to Google drive too so don't worry if you don't pay for Office 365. Browsing is fast and I've had no issues using the Chrome browser on this phone except that you can't close Chrome on the phone. You need to keep a shortcut on the home screen to force close apps until that bug is fixed or you'll drain your battery. Battery life is very good and I can get a full day's use without worry. I usually have about an 1/8 of my battery life left at bedtime and I'd say I'm a moderate to heavy user. The camera takes pictures good enough to capture and share to your albums, but I don't think any professional photographers will stop carrying a better camera around. It's great for the rest of us though. Large beautiful screen, blazing speeds, useful built-in apps, good camera, and just under the 'too big to be a phone' margin... This is a can't miss for Android users that want a great phone that can do more... much, much more."
1632,large number phone is good for low vision people. haven is the only cell for low vision folks i have found
60517,"This is not a USA phone, Very disappointed with display, Moto,Samsung,even OnePlus blows it away...A nd with top teir price ...NO GOOD"
71409,Nice phone for the price. The fingerprint reader is very responsive. But after about a month and a half not so responsive. Still love this phone and will recommend it to anyone.
59798,Excelente producto como se describe lo compre para mi hijo y está genial vamos a seguirla probando precio justo.
76847,"Awesome phone gps works, has volte, nfc, WiFi calling works well my my T-Mobile unlimited plan great camera"
61139,The piece in question was not labelled as an att phone. For thise of you that dont know att and verizon use different types of networks so this phone will not work with verizon. Get an international version instead.
13390,"Good phone, however do not purchase it unless the phone was made for the carrier you currently have. If you have a carrier other than what the phone was made for, you will not have 4G service. Phone will also be very slow in operation. (or you'll have to switch your carrier service.)"
12170,"By far the best smart phone I have ever had. Rugged water proof dust proof and the activity monitor is off the hook. Picture quality, awesome. I'm a big guy so this phone is great due to the larger size touchscreen and it's so rugged feeling. Way to many options to discuss in one sitting. Absolutely love this phone."
21748,I ordered this phone because it was still running KitKat. It arrived in like-new condition and is currently in use. The only thing I hate is that the OTA update was forced pushing me to Lolipop.
30188,Looks like a brand new phone. No problems switching my old Samsung III over; just had to get smaller sim card. Operates pretty much like my old phone. Very pleased with it.
11695,"I like this, but it's not very red. I was hoping to be able to find my phone easier! Battery cover goes on very well."
60168,"Fantastic phone with many features, great camera my 1st non apple phone and am so satisfied with it. I waited for 3 months to get it since AT&T dropped the ball on carrying it, bought from Amazon and the wait was well worth it, I strongly recommend this phone to all my associates."
77205,Not a damn thing it won't answer calls Motorola wont replace it cause it's an international phone and the seller basically flipped me off.$225 3 mo old phone
79452,"I will get the one nitpick out of the way first - the touchscreen is less sensitive than some other phones I've used. I quickly got used to it though. Now, the good news. Nice screen, good in the hand, incredibly battery life (almost 2 days with normal use), very good camera once you tweak it (pretty good even if you don't), smooth fast performance. I got the international model so GPS is very fast (it uses US GPS, Euro GPS, and Glonass). I has edged out the Honor 7x as the best budget phone I've ever bought."
67402,The first phone had a broken screen when I took it out of the box. I think someone stepped or it or dropped the package during shipping. I like the way the phone looks the ram and storage were the selling points for me. but it wouldn't connect to cellular service or mobile data so I returned it.
17719,"I would caution you to buy from this seller, or perhaps I just had bad luck. The first phone I purchased was quirky, so the seller let me pay to return it and sent me another, explaining sometimes the chargers are the issue. The second phone seemed to work okay for a while, but about 6 months in, it won't hold a charge for the whole day, it won't always charge on the charger, and it doesn't perform well with less than 40% battery. The phone looked and arrived new and sealed in the box, so perhaps this is just a bad batch. Bottom line, I would not recommend this phone or seller. I requested to return the phone again, obviously outside the normal time frame, and was denied. The seller recommended I pay someone to get it fixed."
5262,There is no words that discribs this wonderful seller and thus winderful devicet there both so great on tine shipping device works like discribed for me there were No worries
33141,"I am by loyalty a Samsung guy, and by contract a Sprint guy, neither one of these conditions apply to this phone. Today, I set it up for wifi use and it is amazing! It is fast and a very sharp image and transferred all my apps in a matter of minutes. Now the next step is to buy a sim card with some minutes on it. You can get unlimited talk and text for not very much. And although Data isn't as cheap to buy, almost every motel,Dr's office restaurant,coffee shop, Sam's Club or dive club for that matter that you happen to be in has free wifi for patrons, as well as in my town Brighthouse has several hotspots just because. So instead of the horrendous fees that I pay to belong to a network, I may see if working the other way works for me as well. This has a very big screen and a 13 GB camera. Overall, this is a great little phone which I intend to explore further with!"
22603,This phone is great. Recommend to anyone looking for a stylish 2015 phone.
79561,"Excellent product, you pay half price than others phones with similar caractheristics. Great proccessor, great camara, wireless charge."
65133,"The phone I got was supposed to be compatible with ""METRO"" but wasn't. After some investigation, it turns out this phone was formerly ""Sprint"" and won't work properly on Metro. After contacting the vendor there was no hesitation, and they sent me a fully compatible ""METRO"" phone which works perfectly. I have no complaint, though it would have been great to have gotten it right the first time....... Vendor Support Very Good."
236,"Phone came and is okay, but phone was never cleared and had all previous owners information and numbers in it. Not cool."
27229,Received item right on time and it has worked without any issues!
20337,Apps and web pages load quickly. In 2 months of use the system has not crashed. I go an entire day without recharging. Fits easily in my front pocket so I don't notice it's there. Were I looking for an upgrade it would be for improved voice quality. People say they hear me fine. But my test voice messages sound a bit tinny. Also the screen is impossible to read in sunlight. Bottom line for me is the device does what I need and is very stable. I would be hard pressed to justify upgrading to a device that costs $400-600 more.
40210,Phone worked for a couple of months then stopped charging. Contacted Prime Mobility since it fell under the 90day warranty. They said they would check on it and get approval for warranty. Haven't heard anything back. I wouldn't buy another iPhone this way again. Terrible customer service.
25542,"Phone is okay, but for some reason when they say unlocked, it only means you can get service anywhere. This used to be a Metro PCS phone, & I can't get that stuff off of it & moved over to my current carrier for some reason. I'm extremely unhappy about that."
17382,"I expected the phone to show some wear, but for a refurbished phone it had more than expected. Additionally, the battery sent with the phone was faulty and I had to replace it. Unfortunately the battery didn't fail until after the return period for the device. Lastly, the phone continues to reboot which makes it hard to use at times. When the phone first arrived, it would soft reset rarely, but I chalked it up to the phone being new. However, now the reboots are very frequent. The device shows it was dropped, it may have broken some hardware within the phone. I purchased a case, and screen when I bought the phone, and have never dropped it. For the price paid, I expected a better quality device."
2817,"Product did not work on arrival. Due to being out of country, I wasn't able to use the product within the 30 day return window and am now stuck with a $75 paperweight."
17334,"OK... so I've only had it for a week. But I LOVE this phone. It is light-years ahead of my old Razr M. I love the nearly-pure Android experience. Not too much bloatware. The screen is beautiful. It is comfortable to hold. Calls sound great. Media sound pretty darn good on those tiny speakers. So far, it runs as smooth as melted butter. I initially wasn't sure about the constantly flashing notifications and the hand-waving IR sensor notifications, but I have since grown to really like that feature. It is nice to get the status without even touching the phone. I was a little disappointed that the 32GB version isn't available outside the MyMoto website, and that this doesn't have an micro-SD card slot."
39408,No problems at all. I have had it for about a month now. The only thing that I noticed was there was a a faint scratch on the back but that is the only thing that I have noticed. Overall i am pleased with this purchase.
8962,"At first I wasn't sure if I liked it. The phone seemed to have a few glitches but seem to have worked itself off. No sure if its new or refurbished. Either way, it works well. I give 5 stars to shipping though; phone arrived fast."
22083,"I paid a premium for an ""unlocked GSM"" phone. Instead, I got a Verizon-branded phone. Although I can make it work with my T-Mobile account (I think), I am stuck with a Verizon start up, Verizon apps (that I can't disable without screwing up the phone), and a Verizon-specific settings set up that is not the same as my T-Mobile Samsung Galaxy Note 3. I like the Galaxy Note 3. But I did not get what I ordered. If I had wanted a Verizon-branded phone, I would have ordered it."
65138,"Its been 4 days since the phone arrived and it just brought me headache. I put my Straight Talk chip and didn’t work. So I bought a new chip bc I had an intention to change my number, tried the AT&T chip and again didn’t work. I spent more then 5 hours on the phone with the costumer support and nothing. On the next morning went to T-Mobile, it does work, when I’m at the store! As soon as a leave the store stop working, get the signal and loses all the time. It’s just frustrating. Returning it."
6296,"Pros: You can throw this phone across the room and it won't scratch. It's solid. Unlocked = no extra fluff. Call quality/reception seems to be fine. Size is perfect; not huge like most new phones. Battery life is excellent. Cons: Camera is mediocre. Comes with some AT&T apps (unobtrusive, but they're there.) Difficult to find the right size accessories for; you have to get them off of Amazon (which, if you're reading this review, is not likely a problem for you.) I use it on T-Mobile and had to go to the T-Mobile store to pick up a nano SIM card for it. There's no SD card, but I backup my photos on Google and don't store much media, so not an issue for me."
16029,This is a great phone for the money. The wi-fi phone feature is epic.
73321,"Best phone I've ever owned. Love every single feature, especially the display."
2085,"The phone was exactly what I was looking for. It was a gift for my grandmother (her first smartphone) and it was perfect. It was exactly as described, and was shipped secure and fast. I could not be happier with the purchase."
25938,"AT&T Note 5 will accept SD card for storage, I was surprised when I received the phone (which is in good condition) but does not take a SD card.."
78796,Not what it showed as presentation. ALWAYS ROOM FOR IMPROVEMENT
64495,"Phone works great! Got mine from ElectronicDeals. No cracks, scratches, software issues whatsoever. I was honestly really hesitant to buy a refurbished phone but I ended up taking the risk and was not mostly not disappointed. I only had one problem with the phone as a whole: The ""unlocked"" part: When I got the phone I was using MetroPCS but the phone was only half unlocked by Sprint. I was still able to get it activated under Metro and use their service, but signal felt iffy and there was a constant, annoying Sprint OMADM notification in my notification bar. It was out of Metro's hands so I took it to a local Sprint store. They said the only thing they could do was put in a request to get it fully unlocked. They got my number and phone information and I left. Unsatisfied, I decided to try another local Sprint store in the city. The guy at this store said the same thing but he helped me out a bit more. He explained that switching to Sprint would more than likely get rid of notification and improve the service connection. Naturally I was a bit weary about the offer due to being with MetroPCS for long without any problems and he may just be telling me this to make a sale. My worry quickly faded when he told me I would only be paying $25 a month with unlimited everything and I can leave anytime with no strings attached. Like buying the phone in the first place I was hesitant, but ultimately decided to give it a shot. He was right in telling me it would take away the annoying notification and my service is better than ever. Overall, while it all worked out me me in the end, you may want to try to contact the seller before buying just to make sure the phone is 100% unlocked. And if it's not, try to get as much information as possible about so you can unlocked it yourself or at the very least match it up with your current service provider."
12408,"Terrible phone and a rip off! My daughter chose this phone because she's an busy teen, who has on occasion dropped her phone but not excessively. Still, her old phone by Pantech lasted over two years, and is currently in use again since this phone is broken after not even 2 months of use! One of the selling features was the claim of durability of the Samsung Active 6. The first week she had it the screen cracked for no apparent reason, and then last night she dropped it from her back pocket onto a cushioned lamenent floor and now the screen doesn't work period. The drop was only about two feet! We called AT&T but because this is human error the phone isn't covered by warranty, even though it's durability is used as a selling feature. What a rip off! Now we're stuck paying for a phone for the next two years that didn't live up to its description by the manufacturer. A phone that is marketed as durable shouldn't break within two months over a very minor drop, and there's no explanation for the crack in the screen. Makes me wonder if it wasn't damaged during manufacturing and we ended up as the unlucky owners. But how do you prove that? The other explanation is this is just an overpriced and crappy phone. Very disappointed in the product and AT&T's failure to backup their claims about the product."
35502,Really happy with this phone. It came with a scratch on the home button but everything works just like new
60882,"I bought this for my son, going to buy another right now for my Husband, great phone, great price. fast, clear, easy access to everything. Love it."
25249,"No NFC makes it lose a star, but you can't beat it for the price."
37418,"I have replaced this phone twice now. After 6 months of use the battery drains from full charge to 50% in less than 30 minutes. The phone will randomly turn off if it is below 60% and when you turn it back on it says it is at 1%. Every time I have had this phone replaced, the battery has the exact same issue after 6 months. Google Moto Z battery drain and you will see almost every phone has this problem. Spend your hard earned money somewhere else."
31495,Although phone appeared in great condition... it required hours worth of work as the phone was unusable. This company really does not check over these phones for functionality and does not do any updates prior to sending
52729,"Great phone but missing two things: a working charger, and a sim card. With the price of purchasing both you are better off purchasing a new phone. This was a Christmas gift or else I would of returned it."
42175,"Hated this phone, kept freezing on me so I returned it."
45462,I’m trying to return for another phone it gets really hot to the touch after using for a bit. I have owned many iPhones this has never happened with the others. Now I need to turn the brightness down they say that will help. It doesn’t. I don’t think I will buy here again.
78770,Everything worked perfectly for me. Came with a SIM card removal tool. Moved my old SIM card to the XR and followed the on screen instructions to effortlessly transfer everything from my old iPhone.
53856,"This review is specifically for the company Walker and Walker. The phone I received is in nearly perfect condition and as many reviews online agree, it is very well made. However, W&W did not send me a ""Factory Unlocked"" model as described. Instead it is locked to Xfinity Mobile and as such cannot be used on my network. According to Xfinity there is no way for me to be able to unlock it given the situation though all I need is a Network Unlock Code. The service representatives of W&W have been quite helpful thankfully though I am disappointed that this has happened."
69442,You certainly can’t go wrong with this phone. Mine came with no single scratch or dent. Almost new!
27460,"I love this product, I received mine with a bit of scratches on the back of the phone but it works perfectly."
4721,"I've had this phone for about a year and never dropped it once. However, the phone is extremely glitchy and I reboot it often. The store doesn't have any apps that I care for and I've become so frustrated with the performance that I stopped using internet on it all together. This phone is good for anyone who doesn't use internet and has a lot of patience."
11227,Avoid motorola! Terrible warranty service and these phones are super fragile with crap bloatware
80716,They always send a product for missing parts or accessoires
40799,"Not an accurate description. There is absolutely no way to shut off camera sound. Apparently this is a Japanese version which was never disclosed in the listing. (Japan models are made to never mute the camera). Also, charger is not apple."
6934,"Scam... Like many other buyer, I received a 40 lb bag of absorbent instead of the phone...... Amazon, please do something !!!"
31552,"The phone arrived in brand new condition, no cosmetics defects. No accessories besides generic USB cable and adapter. The phone was locked to AT&T but a simple email request to AT&T for the unlock code worked and the phone is now working beautifully."
42605,"Great shape, worked just fine with my Cricket service."
61588,"First phone arrived and looked awesome, but soon noticed that phone would not play sound through headphones. Thought I would try another one, it arrived looking not fully cleaned and with scratches on the screen. Going to try ebay now."
64032,"This was not advertised correctly, took it into the store to get a plan put on it and it’s NOT unlocked. Can’t do anything with it until I figure it who the carrier is because once again it’s NOT UNLOCKED."
66808,Amazing phone. Seriously can't believe how cheap it is for what you're getting. Easily outperforms more expensive phones.
19797,"I had two Samsung cellphones before and that's why I keep buying them. The screen size is perfect for me (my hands are a little big) and the camera is very good. The only issue I found so far (one week using it) is that the camera is slightly bumped out of the back. However, with the case I bought, which is very thin, there's no problem with that anymore. In addition, the cellphone comes with AT&T logo, and I found out only after I received it that it was AT&T unlocked. This is not very clear on the ad. It doesn't bother me though."
76212,It's a great phone bjt the battery drains really fast and I always have to worry about it or charge it two three times per day with normal use.
66550,Bought this about 2 weeks ago and so far it works great! I transitioned from Samsung so there were some differences that I had to get used to but the phone itself works fantastic!!
66479,"I got a flickering problem on the bottom screen within a week of use and trouble with wifi, so now I have to use my old phone while the 5z needs to be repaired. Glad I waited a month for this to come put rather than getting the oneplus 6..."
66380,I love my new phone it took me a minute to see that I hand to get a new SIM card cause I did not know it would not take the same size as my old more 3 but now that I have that this phone is good.
47616,"Some of the comments made me iffy on buying this phone; as it was the first unlocked one I wanted to purchase. There was some trouble registering it with Samsung. After speaking to customer service they were able to help. The warranty is good for a year. The screen is big and clear. I havent had any trouble with the battery. I've only had it for a couple months, so I will make a follow up, if anything changes. But so far, so good."
26557,Sorry but I bought 2 of these phones and they both broke in less than a month. There is a problem with it not charging so your screen is just blank no matter how long you charge it. Also when I received it had scratches around the screen and it was dirty. I was hoping to save money because the price is cheap but I ended up buying 2 broken phones.
56953,"but darn close. I got this used and it arrived looking great, except without the original box, which I really don't care about. Side by side speed comparison (using video games), it isn't as fast as my Sony Xperia XZ premium, but darn close."
19630,I got this for my husband he really did like it but since day one the phone overheat really bad he couldn't hold it second one it would die sooooooooo fast it would charge and after few hours would just die.
61361,"Great phone. Very impressed with its performance and battery life, pictures are ok. But still the best your going to get for 200."
67910,Volume is low and I put it up high. Sometimes cannot hear person I’m talking to.
6086,Excellent phone. Many features. I am still learning to use it. It was highly recommended to me by my computer smart son-in-law.
1104,"This is my third Samsung focus, I love it. have tried other Samsung they do not compare to the focus. Phyllis Jacksonville Il"
41493,"I was very impressed with this phone (still am for many aspects) but there are some major drawbacks 9 months in. The AMOLED screen is burning out in places where status bars are commonly displayed on apps. Static display areas, even from lesser used apps, now have shadows on the screen with a pinkish tint where the pixels are dying prematurely. While I am a heavy user, I have had $100 generic phone screens hold up better, under longer, more intense use. Samsung's choice of AMOLED screen for this model is simply not up to par, unless ""planned replacement"" is their goal Additionally, I have lost the right channel for headphone audio, which is an issue as I listen via cord in my work vehicle (fleet truck, no Bluetooth). This is simply bizarre as I have never had a jack fail, even on decades old $10 Cd players, so seeing such ta hardware failure on a phone of this caliber is unbelievable. The camera is impressive and the phone can handle any app/game I throw at it. Battery life is beyond any phone I have had to date and the quick recharge helps get it back on its feet if I do drain the battery. The blue color is wonderful (a shame I can't find a case to really show it off). However, visible screen failure in 9 months for a flagship phone is simply terrible. I am not a buy-a-phone, replace-it-next year consumer, I was planning on using this device for 3-4 years, but at the rate of screen deterioration it may fade to unusable in less than 2 years. I Combined with the fact that the G935F is an international model phone, it will NOT be supported by Samsung's warranty department. The seller insists they can't put this lack of warranty information in the description because "" the listing is shared with multiple sellers, also controlled/edited by Amazon"", so Amazon gets a big fat zero stars for allowing this glaring omission of very important consumer information, especially in a product that can fail under normal use in less than a year. Finally, the physical home button may be a plus for many, but I find it to have an unnecessarily loud click, and the finger print scanner requires luck or many resets to get accurate and reliable. So, overall, amazing phone, but the screen will not hold out for the life you would expect in a flagship model. Also beware the G935F model because it is not US warrantied and Samsung will not stand behind the product."
54121,"I bought this for my bf so Gus birthday, he absolutely loves it. Fast shipping and great condition. Awesome phone"
33021,"This is probably the best bang for the buck phone I've ever had. I've gotten the $90 phones and the $600 phones, and this is the closest to the $600 phone for the closest to the $90 price I've found. The screen is really nice and processor/memory is snappy enough to do about everything you could want to do. Then thanks to the price tag, you're not paranoid all the time that you might slip and drop it and be out a lot of money (or paying expensive insurance to avoid having that paranoia)."
33116,My power button has sunken in. Within two weeks. I cannot get on my phone. The volume is very poor. Can I have back my money?
66640,"Oh my. If I only knew ten years ago what two hundred bucks can buy you in our days. Xiaomi, I do not know how you do it, but you deliver it every time. You got yourself a one loyal customer here. Thank you. The phone is outstanding in terms of performance, responsiveness, and looks. There are plenty of excellent thorough reviews out there, I am just here to confirm, it is all true."
54282,"El telefon es bonito se ve muy bien el color blanco, funciona muy bien hasta el momento, pero el tamaño del teléfono, estaría mejor si fuera un poco más pequeño, minimo un centímetro, centímetro y medio menor."
4856,"This is my first smart phone, and I am very pleased with 99% of the technical specs on the phone. The phone is incredibly user friendly, THE VIDEO AND PHOTO IMAGING ARE BY FAR SUPERIOR TO ANYTHING I HAVE SEEN IN NYC (BEING SURROUNDED BY PEOPLE WHO CAN'T LIVE WITHOUT A SMART PHONE)ON ANY ANDROID OR APPLE DEVICE. The Battery Life is also significantly better. I can't compare it to the specs on the Galaxy IV because that was a higher price range, but compared to the Galaxy IV & the Apple I5 this has 32 GB of storage! Based on what I have read it is 720 HD resolution for Netflix and YouTube. The Galaxy IV or Apple I5 are both 1080p. For me personally this is not significant for a five inch screen. It records in 1080 HD and can be connected to your TV via an HDMI cable. Although the music app is Nokia Music Tunes, you can upload the majority of your I-tune library via a Windows 7 or 8 PC. The only negative for me regarding this phone is the lack of Apps primarily regarding Video application such as HBO GO, Showtime Anytime, and Amazon Prime video watching. THE REASON FOR THIS IS THE PHONE DOES NOT SUPPORT ADOBE FLASH PLAYER, hopefully this will change in the near future. I WAS NOT MADE AWARE OF THIS PRIOR TO PURCHASING THE PHONE AND I AM ACTUALLY SURPRISED IT DOES NOT SUPPORT IT. IF WAS AWARE OF THIS ADVANCE IT WOULD HAVE PLAYED A MAJOR FACTOR IN MY PHONE CHOICE. SO FOR SPORT ADDICTS DURING PLAYOFF TIME THIS PHONE WILL NOT HELP YOU AT THE MOMENT. Another MAJOR PLUS if you actually use a smart phone in Business; is that it comes with all Microsoft Office applications, Excel, Word, Outlook, Notebook, and Power Point. If you decide to get this phone I highly recommend you attain the phone here or at Best Buy, a Verizon store or Verizon online will cost you double which is simply not necessary. When I saw how it was priced online, here and other sites, I was disgusted with Verizon. I was eligible for an upgrade, but the only difference in the end between myself as an existing Verizon customer, and a new Verizon customer (the service as a carrier is superior) was a mere 5 dollars. I hope the better business bureau looks into Verizon wireless, because the reality is for existing Verizon customers, it is a bate and switch scam, I was content with my ""dumb"" phone, and their email to me that I would get an upgrade at a discount was simply a means to get me into the store. I could have upgraded my device here and saved A LOT of money. that being said for 50 dollars you are getting an awesome phone that I would put up there with the I phone 5 (with much better battery life) and any high end Android Device. In summary Great Phone- if you are a TV addict you need a Droid or I phone at this juncture and this phone is not for you. As far as Verizon DO NOT buy it at verizonwireless.com or in at a Verizon retail store you will pay double. Otherwise you can see for yourself as the specs are clearly outlined by Amazon, and it does import most music files from I-tunes."
75552,"What can I say that hasn't already been said about the phone. It's a top tier phone with the best screen on the market. The cameras take amazing pictures and the three lenses with their apertures give you a lot of flexibility in photo taking. The battery easily lasts a day so most people should be fine unless they're heavy power users. But even for those folks, the phone does charge up really quickly. I also love the speakers on the phone. The two channel sound with Adobe Atmos sound really create the illusion of surround sound (within reason. This is a phone after all.) I picked up the phone during prime day when they were selling them at a $300 discount so for that price, the phone was a no brainer for me. Upgrading from a Galaxy S7, this was a nice leap for me. I don't know if I would recommend the phone at $900 but that's mostly on principle. I don't believe any phone should cost as much as a midrange laptop. So, if you can pick this phone for a reasonable price, I would highly recommend it."
81311,"Estoy muy satisfecho con este teléfono, me compré dos y hasta la fecha no he tenido ningún tipo de problemas con ambos"
3229,"I replaced my droid incredible with the razr M - I had the incredible for 2 years and it never crashed completely even once, I've had the razr m for a month and it has crashed twice - requiring hard reset - pretty much the exact same apps loaded so I really don't think that is the problem. additionally the sound was terrible for about a week - happened suddenly, I made a call and it sounded like a blown speaker in your car sounds. all calls I made after that had the same problem. I was going to bring it by the verizon store and trade it in (or whatever) but as anyone knows who goes to a verizon store, you need to have at least an hour to wait to be even spoken to and I was busy with work so I didn't have time to go and in about a week it suddenly improved. I'm guessing that problem is going to come back. I like the phone a lot otherwise but I think it is produced more cheaply with cheaper parts than the incredible I used to have. I'm going to keep it and it's likely any other droid produced today is going to have similar problems so why bother frustrating myself with trying to take it back but I'm definitely disappointed."
80146,"I just over love my phone, just what I was looking for. Reasonable price love the camera, lightweight. Love it"
29211,I broke my phone’s screen and needed an immediate replacement. It has been a few month now and it has been working just fine. No complaints.
14619,"Not bad for a used phone. It looked just like it came from the box. This phone is not top of the line, so it was perfect for my mother who wanted a large screen with not too many bells and whistles. What a great buy, refurbished products fulfilled amazon in my experience are always top notch."
45210,"I purchased a refurb unit from Blutek. I am thoroughly satisfied. The display glass is flawless and the battery is at maximum capacity. It came with an aftermarket power adapter and no headphones. Besides that, my unit is basically brand new. Highly recommended buying through Blutek."
73276,"This is my best investment also now the price may drop a lot because of USA war with China, but still highly recommend to friend due to the good quality of camera and battery life."
70307,So far very happy with my new Nokia phone. I have had it for a few weeks now. My first Android. I couldn't see spending a lot of money for an iPhone so I thought I would give it a try. I like the fact that AndroidOne was used so that Google updates will come faster including security updates. The new os (pie) made it a bit better as well. I have the 64gb model and added external SSD but haven't really needed that yet. The only minor downside is the very slippery case but that can easily be fixed with a protective case and I haven't bothered to get one yet.
35766,I received my s7 today. I charged it and after it was charged it I found that it discharges at a very quick rate. Ten percent in let that ten minutes. 100° to 90° in ten minutes without use!!
14702,"I really liked the galaxy mega because I have had one before like in 2015 and when I ordered this one I figured it would be great, but every time I'm on the phone talking to anyone , my call drops where I'm at home or out and about. The Internet goes off & on by itself. When I turn on the GPS it doesn't work. It tells me that I'm off line, so if I needed directions I would be screwed. I can't even download cash app on this device or my mobile banking app for my bank & It won't even pick up on WiFi in other places when I try to use it like if I'm at a restaurant or something. I tells me that I'm off line & to try again later. With my other phone that I had I didn't have this problem. I didn't have any problems. I only got this phone because I mistakinglly dropped my phone for the first time & my screen was busted & cracked, but my phone still worked but my screen was just cracked."
13979,"hi good evening .. I am writing this time to report that the phone which will buy the 31 December 2011, I came to my country Venezuela on Saturday 25 February, and since then from the day Tuesday started just 3 days to submit failures .. the cell phone just restarts, hangs on and off .. I would like to know what happens .. I await your prompt response"
8486,"This is a great phone. I love the big screen. The phone is fast, which is very important to me since my last phone had a very long and annoying lag time when I tried to make phone calls. Apps run quickly. The camera takes nice pictures. A couple of annoying things about it are: 1) The audio volume rockers are directly opposite the screen on/off button, which results in many unintentional presses that change the volume when trying to turn off the screen or turning off the screen when trying to adjust the volume. 2) There is no way to turn the sound on and off from the lock screen. Also, the rocker switch doesn't have any effect with the screen off or the lock screen on. To silence or un-silence the phone, it's necessary to unlock the phone and then use the volume rockers. 3) The video recording software freezes often."
82335,"I got this A70 for my mom after a disaster with a Samsung Galaxy S8 from straight talk there 4G did not work, So I brought it back to Walmart, now I wish I had just bought it unlocked to begin with. The camera in it is so amazing, I had it when it first came out. I just want to get my mom a decent phone that she's happy with. I can't complain regarding the unlocked Samsung A70 for the price the screen is bigger brighter and more luxurious looking than my Samsung Galaxy S10 Plus! It's really beautiful! On top of that it came free service! Three months of free phone service 8 gig of high-speed data by Mint Mobile no strings attached, through walmart online. The only negative part I can find is camera quality! If you want top notch landscapes or selfies this isn't the phone for you. That's why I got the Samsung Galaxy S10 plus, Landscapes and night shots are very important to me. I was expecting the A70 to be pretty decent because of the 3 rear lenses. Just the way it looks and feels I really thought it would take real good quality pics. Even with the newest update says improved camera quality and included a new night mode like the S10 Plus has. The pics lack the proper color saturation with selfies especially. Landscapes are ok as long as you don't try to zoom at all. I'm not sure what purpose the three lenses serve, or if they're there more for show like a value phone copying the S10 Plus. I guess I have 15 days to decide, if my mom is unhappy with the camera then I guess I'll be going with the unlocked S8 plus. But I have to say the 3 months of free service and 8 gig of high-speed 4G data was a huge highlight to buying this phone!"
71491,"Really like the phone. Everything is good - speed, camera, feel, display and so on. Did not like ads in system apps but there is a way how to turn them off. But after several weeks of using on T-Mobile network unfortunately often calls drop and nobody could reach me on the phone sometimes. I bought from different store, so I'll see other options..."
65023,"I found this was a perfect upgrade to my S6. I couldn't be happier. no buyer's remorse. the dedicated fingerprint sensor is effective and fast, the earphone connector is priceless. Samsung will lose me if it's not brought back on my next upgrade."
42074,I got an off brand charger but as far as the phone goes it appears to be the same as a brand new one. I may order one for the wife
54997,"This is a great phone. It does come with some 'apps' installed including twitter and facebook and you have no way of uninstalling these. I saw this as a downfall of the phone because I got it to go off the grid. But the 3g makes it so slow you wouldn't want to use data on this phone anyway. The bluetooth connects to my car better than my old smartphone. A great way to disconnect and control your data consumption. My mind feels clear with having this phone rather than having the constant need to look at my phone, I find myself forgetting about it for hours at a time. Strongly recommend this phone."
71095,This phone does not keep a battery charge long and keeps kicking me off of Bluetooth not recommended bought twice two of them and they both did the same thing
74207,The phone does so much! I The finger print scanner is spot on amazing. I was concerned that I wouldn't like the size but I've gotten used to it & it is an excellent phone especially for the money! It is an amazing bargain. I & goodnight recommend the phone.
45340,I love this phone!! It’s quick and works perfectly for me. I’m so happy with it
42705,Very good phone. I thought they would come with headphones though
46344,"The camera is absolute crap, but if you download an app, using THAT with the camera works well. I dont understand that at all, but... whatever works. Battery lasts forever. Tough phone. Pleased with my purchase."
4241,Great purchase! Exactly what I ordered! I got it really fast too & had no problems getting it turned on at Verizon!
76500,A great phone for the money. Camera is excellent. I had a g5 which was a good phone. This phone is better
52141,"I have never enjoyed a phone more. The storage issues were erased with a MicroSD card. I NEVER have battery anxiety. The phone has truly lasted me over 2 days between charges. Now, I think the camera is just fine, but if you measure your worth on Instagram, maybe this isn't the phone for you. I've owned Pixels, Galaxies, and iPhones and the MotoE4 Plus, has served me better than all of them. Oh, BTW, I got it for $115 on the Sunday after Black Friday. Not the best deal ever, but close. Can't wait for the E5 Plus b/c I will be getting it."
53933,"el celular a los 5 meses presentó problemas en la pantalla, y ahora no carga, quiero un reemboloso o un cambio"
14228,"Becomes a memory hog after few weeks of usage. The phone didn't come with a charger, even though it came directly from Amazon."
25336,"Samsung Galaxy S5 SM-G900T GSM Unlocked Cell Phone, 16GB - Black (Certified Refurbished) Phone is looking good but performance too bad interms of battery and phone functionality"
22534,I love my s6 active. I've had it for several months now and just got around to reviewing it. It is everything that it was described as - very durable and functional for an active -busy - rough user... I would absolutely recommend this phone.
18431,"Bought this phone a couple weeks ago from Amazon, got a plan from AT&T and inserted a SIM, and the phone it has an ancient version of Android OS on it, preventing some apps from installing. It had Lollipop (version 5.1) installed. I needed 6, so I tried with System->Check for updates and it said ""Software is up-to-date"" and would not update the OS. There is a Marshmallow Update app on the desktop I launched and after going through a number of screens it finally says: ""ERROR!!! Your Device Is Not Compatible"" I contacted AT&T support and they told me I needed to contact Samsung support. I did, and after waiting for 20 minutes on hold and another 30 minutes on the phone, following various sets of instructions, all of which fail, he said I had to go into a Best Buy and bring my phone. The nearest Best Buy is 3 hour drive for me. So he looked up other stores that have Samsung upgrade tools and there was none closer. So he finally submitted a ticket and then send me a support authorization to send my phone to Samsung so they can upgrade the OS and send it back to me. I probably have to pay for the postage as well, though I don't know yet. So unless you want to live with a phone that is on Android 5.1 (Android 7 is already available now), and never be able to upgrade the OS without taking it to a Samsung dealer or sending it to Samsung, I recommend you do not buy this phone. I should have bought it direct from AT&T but wanted to save a few bucks. Dumb decision. My bad. And Amazon's fault for selling phones that are very old without first upgrading the OS. And Samsung's fault for not being able to push an update."
53577,Ordered a black se for my dad. But this is what I get. Give me money back.
80873,Don't know this was the international version. It's bounces from lte to edge randomly no matter what TMobile apn i use. Anytime i make a phone call it's drops to 3g which i never noticed on any other unlocked device i had in the past.
25890,Item was listed as new but I'm pretty sure it was refurbished. My phone worked amazing for 2 weeks. Then one day my screen would start flashing every time I locked my screen. Seller refunded my money upon return.
11254,Great phone and the battery last a long time on a charge
35104,"So far, after a week, everything seems in perfect condition. I am very happy with my new phone. Camera is a delight, batteries are strong, and I love the size of the SE."
73513,I love this phone I did alot of digging to ensure this device is factory unlocked and I am happy that it is. My phone has this weird speaker thing where the balance shifts all weird but I mostly use bluetooth headsets so it's fine and other than that I love this thing
6201,Amazing battery life and good display. Bought it for my aunt. She loves it Elderly will prefer the huge screen note 3. http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00F2SDM00?ie=UTF8&camp=213733&creative=393185&creativeASIN=B00F2SDM00&linkCode=shr&tag=swiclu-20&linkId=RCMIBKLNN5BNUD5D&refRID=04754BBX2BT8DEB8YB50 Love android!
914,"I just bought two of these and tried to activate NET10 service to use the Verizon CDMA network. I turned on the phone and see that it says a service from Tracfone. I read these reviews and do not recall anyone mentioning this. I absolutely do not want Tracfone. I am really upset about this right now. Best of all, the activation and phone plan I paid for did not get completed because the Tracfone server was too busy. Otherwise, though, the seller described the product accurately and the expedited delivery I requested occurred as scheduled as well. The seller did a great job. Too bad the product appears to be a bait and switch and money for absolutely nothing in terms of the ""service"" plan."
25346,I've had some issues with it haven't even had it for 4 months yet and already having issues just spend the extra money to buy a new one
2988,"UPDATE (May 2016): When I finally switched to an iPhone last month -- after the THIRD Motorola DROID RAZR M died in a two-year period (basically every 7 1/2 - 8 months, like clockwork), the Verizon tech who was helping me said this model comes back ALL. THE. TIME. Buyer beware.....(End update) I have loved my Motorola Droid phones -- they are the only smartphone I have ever had, even though others have tried to lure me over to the iPhone, but this is ridiculous. I got my first Razr M in April of 2014, as an update when it was time to renew my contract. I liked that it was thinner than the phone I was replacing (a Droid 4), and it seemed to be a great phone overall. Fast forward to January 2015 -- right at eight months -- and it would not even turn off, but neither would it turn ON. I had been having to reboot it multiple times per day, as it kept freezing. One night during a reboot, it got stuck on the start-up screen with the red glowing symbol...and it stayed there until the battery died. If I recharged it, the same thing would happen. So since it was (thankfully) still under warranty, Verizon replaced it. That was January 2015. By early July 2015, I was once again rebooting my phone multiple times a day. Text messages were not always being delivered, the phone did not vibrate for incoming calls when it was on vibrate (so I missed a lot of important calls), and it was generally undependable. I took it in to Verizon and they examined it, telling me to remove a few particular apps and do a factory reset. Ibdid, and within a week, I was back because that had not fixed anything. So in late July 2015, the phone was replaced AGAIN. It is now the end of November -- just four months later -- and this third Razr M is driving me bananas. It reboots itself randomly (sometimes several times a day), I have people telling me they get the same text from me more than once , I find others have sent me texts I never receive, it once again does not vibrate on incoming calls when I have set it to vibrate....I am just DONE. I can understand a phone here and there having problems, but three models of the same phone in less than two years that cannot make it more than eight months before dying? That tells me there is something wrong with the overall design."
62513,"Very poor reception at my home. Much less than my old Iphone. I had to change services to use the nearest tower, and then add a booster for it to work. Even then not a good signal in some of my house areas."
45111,So far my phone is working perfectly fine as a new one thank you so much
66169,"Great looking updated to Oreo out of the box beautiful baby blue metal back great phone all around liked my g5 LOVING MY g6 plus BX, NY"
55097,Just what my daughter wanted. She is very happy with it.
30177,Looked like good condition the back had a piece slightly sticking up and battery life is kinda poor. Without touching it at all died 13 percent with in 2 hour time frame
62999,"I have been a loyal Samsung phone person since the S3. I have had 2 S models, 2 different Actives and 2 different Notes, the most recent the Note 8. Two things bothered me about the Samsung. First the battery life kept getting shorter and second, the Samsung Software that was all over the phone. I made the decision to go to a smaller phone and the Sony Experia XZ2 Compact was the smallest flagship I could find. This phone addressed both my Samsung complaints. First of all the battery life is far and above better than Samsung. I think this is because of the combination of the smaller screen size and fewer apps running in the background. I am a heavier user and I still only run down to 40% by the end of the day. Second is the android experience. This is much more like the Nexus phone I had a few years ago. It doesn't have Bixby or Samsung cloud and other apps running in the background. It lets you use what you want and doesn't force anything else on the user. The fact that this phone is a 5"" model makes it pocket friendly but the screen is large enough to be functional. It was only a few years ago that this was the standard size before the Phablets took over. I recommend this phone and can assume that the full size version is equally as good."
1284,"Excellent experience all around. Delivery was quick, everything came as advertised, and the phone is terrific. If people would get over their Microsoft hangups they would see what a great platform Windows Phone 7 is."
2495,"I bought this phone to be a simple, easy to use phone to replace a slider with a menu that was difficult to navigate. You don't have to use the SIM card for the prepaid plan that comes in the package. I just took the old SIM card out of the old cell phone and put it into this new phone, and that was all it took to switch the service for the old cell phone number to this phone. Something awesome that discovered is that is phone changes on a standard microUSB cable, so if you already have a Kindle charger, it will work for this phone also! It was very easy to add items to the ""Go To"" menu for quick access to make it silent and to check voicemail. The only thing I don't like about this phone is that it doesn't have a screen on the outside. When a call comes in, you have to open the phone to see who is calling. Not much of an issue for me. It does have a default setting that when you open the phone during an incoming call, you can choose to answer or decline the call. It does not automatically answer when you open it. Nice compact phone that slides easily into pocket or purse! I have been very happy with it!"
32175,"Very nice upgrade from my other Samsung cell phone. Samsung brand has never let me down and with the purchase of the s7 its track record is still intact .Phone looks great, video plays beautifully one it and pictures are awesome. Best thing is was as described as the seller had said , when I got the phone it was new but thanks to amazon I didnt pay new prices so it made the phone even nicer. I really like the little feature of the time showing on the front of it so one doesn't have to turn on phone its self to see the time. The only thing wrong I see with the phone isn't actually with the phone but the fact is I didn't get headphones or the sim tool either , but those are not deal breakers. I do not use earbuds any and I was able to use a paperclip to open the sim card holder. Friendly heads up to metropcs users yes it does work on it. Because it is my carrier and when I took it in they had no problem switch it over . So over all very happy with the purchase."
8798,"Brings blows and dribbling in chrome but what I care about is the system, we will see that it continues to work in a few months."
37340,I absolutely love this phone and mainly for the camera possibilities. Do not hesitate to purchase a phone outside of your AT&T dealer. Get what you want. I wanted small (fits in pocket) and great camera. I got both.
70885,"Amazing. The stylus is a game changer and has become a tool for me as an artist I simply didnt think could exist. I am addicted to drawing on it. The native apps are mediocre as per usual but 10$ on autodesk sketchbook pro on this phone is a dream, you can draw at 10000 x 10000 pixels with layers and export to PSD, print out at 300 dpi in huge dimensions. Was looking at the note 9 and possibly 10 but the price to value ratio is clearly with a refurb S8, no regrets, other than wanting to draw on this phone forever."
50129,ordered the refurbished phone of the google pixel. I have my original that is still working with no problems. The first one i tried to put to work for my company would not read the sim card. wasted. the second would not take any updates. I have a third that sites at a job-site with the more relaxed employees that is still working. not such a good buy if you have to actually use the phone. 1 for 3 working phones. not so good.
50122,"Awesome phone! Awesome deal on the price! It's certified refurbished, unlike those eBay sellers who say refurbished. This phone is like brand new! It even comes in the pixel box. I do wish I paid the small extra to go with the 128gb pixel XL because the pixel doesn't use a memory card and 32gb isn't very much memory. You do get free unlimited Google cloud storage for owning the pixel so maybe 32gb will be sufficient!"
78927,I always feel like I might drop the damn thing and it weighs a pound. Who the would wan this? I'd just buy an ipad. Why is this the entry level phone? Now I have to go back and pay more money for a smaller phone? what the hell Apple?
77565,Not a bad phone for its price. A few months in and can’t complain.
4226,nice big screen not as big as some new phones but much cheeper could get better reception though. Great camera lousy built in app to sort pictures / albums better free ones available
43467,"I bought a Galaxy S6. The first one they sent me had a microphone problem, I could hear but the person on the other end could not hear me unless I had head phones in. So they took the phone back and sent me another phone.... Second Galaxy S6 worked fine for 2 weeks, then it started turning off and on. then it stopped turning on and would only turn on randomly. Which was VERY inconvenient. Especially dealing with sprint to activate the phones, and having to pay for shipping 2 times. I messaged them asking for a refund, due to me passing the 30 days they said they can only exchange the phone. So i'm waiting to see if the third phone they send will even work. It's a little frustrating that they don't check the phones 100%. If I were you I would buy a phone else where. Nothing but frustration and a waste of money. I'll update my review when I receive the third phone. Loved the Galaxy phone, if only it worked!"
65861,I have had this phone for only 2 months or so. It's over heating once used for a period of time. And shuts down even when charged...lately it's not keeping the charge and I could literally seeing the battery training like a ticking clock before my eyes. Also the phone isn't meant to be opened but one side of the back Is opening and I can see all the glue that was used to seal it coming apart at the sides. I need to get a replacement.
66578,Within a day of having it I was at about 17% and it just shut down on me and when it restarted it says that the battery wasn’t gettin enough of something and due to that it had to restart. A little weird but other than that it’s worked fine for me goin on day 3
60734,I like the color but the phone size could be bigger. The charger lasted only 2 days before it stopped charging my phone. Please improve your charger.
11517,I had a problem with shipping in that I got 2 of them when I only ordered 1 so I sent 1 back and had to pay shipping of which I never got reimbursed. I was never charged for the second phone. I enjoy the phone and it was exactly what I was looking for.
49196,"Excellent phone. Fast and responsive. Easy to use. Unlocked. I use it with MetroPCS and I had no issue when i took it in, they just plug and play your simcard from your old phone (I had an iphone 4S). Doesn't cost you a cent to activate it or pay for a new sim. (If they try to charge you, refuse, and tell them to make it work with your previous SIM!!). Also, aesthetically, the phone looks awesome. Great screen display, camera quality. BUY IT. Get the phone from the seller ""99Direct"". Just bought it from them and it looks brand spanking new, works like new as well."
34320,"The phone is in perfect working condition, without scratches o signs of use. Battery is perfect (I get home at night with over 70%). I missed the earphones, but I guess that's the key to the bargain."
65134,"I was sent a defective phone. Wasted over an hour with my phone provider to get it connected and re-install all my apps only to find out the sound when someone calls doesn't work 90% of the time, where I can't hear anyone speaking and no one can hear me, causing alot of frustration. Can't even hear the line ringing while calling someone. I'm hoping this was just a coincidence so I ordered another one and once I receive it I'll send back the defective one. You just have to think, if it was used and returned then it's probably because someone bought it new and for one reason or another had issues with it. Gonna give it one more shot and reorder another used one in case I just had a bad apple in the bunch, but so far really disappointed. Update: received the second phone and so extremely to see the same issue except this time the only way the other line will hear me is if I set the phone to speaker phone!!! Garbage, don't waste your time. 2 defective phones is unacceptable."
67063,"Sorry, this video is unsupported on this browser.  This phone is better than you'd be led to believe. People have complained about the rear mounted speaker and that the rear of the phone is made of plastic, but neither of these have proven to be troublesome just yet. It helps if you get a case, too. The screen is decent, nothing special but it won't be an eyesore for the vast majority of people. MIUI also allows you to set color temperature, which is a nice feature I wish was built in to more phones. This is so good. The only complaint I have in regards to the screen is that the aspect ratio does make the phone feel a little long and makes pressing buttons towards the top of the phone a bit of a chore. The camera is acceptable, nothing special but it gets the job done. I do recommend keeping the glass in front of the lenses clean, as there has been noticeable streaking in some pictures I've taken with it. Otherwise, it's not bad, but don't expect to win any photography awards with it, especially in low light. Overall, I can't find much wrong with this phone, especially for the price. One thing I will say is that you need to be careful when purchasing accessories for this phone, as I've already had one instance of ordering something that was listed as being for this phone that was actually made for another. Past that, I can't recommend this phone enough. Xiaomi has won a loyal customer."
7501,"The phone works very well. ! I would recommend this to others, as well as buy another one."
48632,"This phone is nice. Easy to use. No adds. Talk, text, gps and google look ups are easy. Screen resolution is good. I'm glad I chose this phone. Battery is good to. I use this phone everyday, during work, and it hasn't failed me yet."
35940,Loved the phone looks practically new works very well. Shipped very fast.
20328,"Bought this Samsung because my S4 went out on me and I was stuck with a little cheap phone I used for a while. To me it works the same as the other galaxys. If anything changes I'll be back, but it works great for prepaid. And the SIM card was already included if you were wondering. It was cheaper than in an actual Verizon store is why I shopped on Amazon. It saved me alot....compared to the retail prices in store."
54980,"Does what it needs to. Snake is awesome. Cons: Group texts are not possible, music can't be played over bluetooth. Bluetooth is only for external speaker during calls."
28883,"Extremely bad experience! Opened the phone today, put the sim in and it worked ok for a few minutes after which it heated up and went into a continuous boot loop. I've done all basic troubleshooting but to no avail! Extremely disappointed!"
75333,"Good phone for a medium user. Battery life is really good. Screen is mesmerizing. Camera is very good in the outside, although in low light conditions it's a little noisy. Fine print sensor is exceptionally good. Overall the phone works great, single hand use is easy and ergonomic. Very pleased with the phone in general, great value for money."
72902,This phone has everything except a working call functionality. There are thousands of forums talking about call quality issue. Google has not issued an official fix yet and it is frustrating to have a phone in 2019 that can't place calls properly.
50004,"First one died after two days. Replacement had no functioning audio - no mic, no speaker. ""Certified"" refurbished did nothing for quality control."
77122,"This is my second Motorola Android phone, the first one was the Z Play. This is a nice upgrade for a good price, with amazing battery life. Love all the Motorola extras, simple ways of using the phone."
50252,"Received a good quality phone in package. It's fairly adequate. Hardly any scratches (none really) which is great for a renewed device. The battery is terrible though but everything else is great. If you're going to buy this phone, I am implore you to buy a replacement battery as you may need one."
61207,Comes damaged with a broken charger with no headphones and the charger
80795,"This is a GREAT phone that matches or exceeds some flagship devices. The battery is an all day (and night) one that will keep the phone runnning for a lo g time. The only real downside to the phone is the wonky in screen fingerprint reader. You have to place your finger EXACTLY correct to have it function. Even then, there is a lag. Beyond that, call quality and pictures are great."
58183,"The phone works like it’s brand new, only one tiny scratch on the back of the phone by the logo and It doesn’t come with the original charger but who cares? It’s just a charger. The phone works perfectly and it has a 90 day warranty. It’s on about week 3 for me and I love it."
48657,"i have bought this phone in January 2018, now it is February 2019, and phone does not ring any more , just makes low vibration sounds, that can be heard only 1 foot away. Can not use it any more, have to look for a new one. Do not recommend to buy."
37384,"Yet again Sony has made a small phone that is excellent in a lot of ways, but the most fragile Android phone on the market. During the first small drop with a rubber case: CRACK broken. Otherwise, this is an excellent phone."
44111,"The phone worked the first week or so, but now it just keeps turning on and off. The battery doesn't last. We never got it to send photos via text messaging. A total waste of money! I will never buy a phone through Amazon again."
12812,Good night this phone is unlocked i can use outside United States.
2143,"the phone is in excellents conditions and looks very good, but didnt has charger. dont know where they left the charger. the other things are ok"
72502,"I have had this phone for awhile now and I have to say, I love it. It charges quickly, battery life is awesome. Camera is great, works fast. I love everything about this phone. I highly recommend it"
23151,"Well my first time buying a phone on amazon I was skeptical, but ended up saying yolo and went for it. I love this phone especially since I grew up using androids this is the smoothest running one I've ever had! The specs on this device are great and hasn't slowed down on me at all! The seller ""Mobile Shop USA"" was great and amazing on shipping time, speed and safety of the package! I had one tiny issue but when contacting the seller they responded quickly and fixed the problem in under 12 hours! The device was basically looked brand new and i was so shocked it was even used once! i recommend it for anyone wanting to get an android!"
40437,Like most people I needed another phone without setting up a payment plan. I have had my phone for 4 months. I have not had a problem.
17644,Received it before the Christmas and it was brand new. It came with the Red Nokia box along with the charger and manual. Great price!
15091,Worded great for about 2 months. Now I'm having trouble with the mobile data working and it keeps killing batteries. Not impressed.
62567,"This phone is great for everything! The Camera blows phones of its price range out the water, the GPU/Processor makes gaming super smooth, and all the issues a usual defect would have aren't present here at all! Overall, I would definitely recommend this phone if you're tight on budget."
64727,"There is no original packaging,so when i got it ,i haven't been so happy as getting original product with package . Also there is no akg headphones included.I've installed phone info from samsung in google play and battery is not at 100% health,it's got 94.03% so phone has got ~3300 mah,it is not enough for such screen and chipset."
39372,"I like my new phone. It just what I was looking for. The good pictures, videos"
13541,This phone worked for one day and then the screen cut off and nothing after that!
66493,"I've read, watched and did my research on this phone over the span of 3 months since its released. I have to say man, This phone is MAGNIFICENT!! It just have everything you need in one place!! Incredible photo ops, the sight of this phone is just so beautiful. Update on Cons: So I've only been using this phone about 3 weeks now and I notice that when I type my finger would always hit the home button underneath the keyboard and it would exit out what wrote which is certainly kind of annoying so I have to slow down on my typing to make sure I don't hit the home or back key."
38204,"The phone was great for a while, then it started having issues with calls - ie. can't receive them at all. The call function in both the phone app and other messaging apps shuts down when I try to answer a call. I talked to Google and Amazon support then eventually talked to a repair place that told me it was a motherboard issue that is no longer being replaced by google. So now I've got a phone that doesn't phone a few months after buying it. I'd recommend just springing for a newer/different phone rather than risk getting one with a bad motherboard."
29950,"Spent over $620 for this in June 2016. Back separated from the front at one year - and I am NOT hard on this phone. It had a protective cover. The only reason I knew of the separating was when I decided to add an SD card. I shoved the cover back on it and hoped that since it was tight fitting that the cover would keep it together. THEN shortly after 13 months of use, it got black lines running across the screen. That was temporary but very annoying while it lasted. Then a gray bar at the bottom for awhile and I had to back-up my stuff and do a factory reset. THEN after the latest update a week and a half ago or so a thick black bar appeared over the bottom 1/4 of my screen. Couldn't go landscape, couldn't see the majority of the keyboard or the icons near the home button. Took it to a local repair shop today and he said ""it can't be fixed. Either the connection is bad re: display or it's been damaged somehow."" I've been extremely careful with this phone and I'm angry that I spent all of my hard-earned money on this piece of crap! NEVER again Samsung. NEVER again! Now I'm without a cell phone and have to figure out what to do next. I love Consumer Cellular service and I'm staying with them, HOWEVER, I will NOT go with an Apple or Samsung and that's all THEY offer in phones so here I go again - I'll buy a GSM unlocked phone."
53263,"Fantastic phone with some pretty incredible speed for playing games, lots of features that make it well worth having. Good size, not too big or to small, love the sony brand and all that they do for electronics and this is no exception."
38395,"Bought this for my husband in April 2018, and the phone died in November 2018. He plays games on his phone, so he killed the battery often when playing games. So one day he put it on the charger and it simply wouldn't turn back on. Looked up how to force boot, and after a couple of days where he could actually start the phone, it finally died completely. Now it won't even get past the Google screen."
38539,Perfect cell phone that I didn't have it before from google wich they manufactured it hardware and software and I always like google cell phones and the google company finely they produced a perfect cell phone that I wish it from long time that they make it by google the body and software both pure android. Thanks Amazon thanks Google. It's really a premium platinum cell phone.
67289,Bought this for my son and he loves this phone. He wanted a smaller Smart Phone and this was what he chose. He reports on problems and truly liked the colors of it. Hence his using a clear case. Life's good.
75280,I received my phone and the battery dies almost immediately and the pen that came with the phone didn't work
20050,This was a waste of money and time. Phone has horrible reception and internet service.
56039,"I bought a Pixel 2 XL 128 MB. on the Google store. Great camera. Very fast phone. But...After 2 weeks of use, a horizontal translucent black band appear in the middle of the screen. Now I have several days trying to contact Google for the guarantee, without any success."
56249,This case is good quality and holds my iPhone with a protective case on it without any issues . The clip is durable as I frequently put it on and take it off .
35728,My girlfriend bought this to replace her iphone 5. Unfortunately this did not work well with her service provider Sprint. The voice and text worked but the data service failed. We took it to several Sprint stores and looked up APNs online but nothing worked to turn on the data. Even customer service was unable to get the data working. Frustrated and and upset she went back to an iphone and bought a 6s. I ended up taking the phone and used it on my Tmobile. No issues. Works great. Good camera and the data does work! I do like this phone and so did she. If you want a Samsung s7 edge you'll be forced to buy from only Sprint. BYOD doesn't work well if you use Sprint.
32648,Phone asks for code from previously used google acct...will not unlock...used phone advertised as new
71556,Speaker makes a loud crackling or popping noise whenever any sound is playing. This phone came with a note saying it was checked so that all functions were working properly. This obviously isn't true.
15484,"Used sold as New! a AT&T locked phone, NOT unlocked! Scam!"
48580,"I don't need the latest greatest and am not easily wowed by wiz-bang features and flashy lights. I just want it to work. I love the finger print reader but otherwise it is just nice having one that is quick and functional. I am of the opinion that $100 is not throw away money. Seems like a lot of smart phone addicts buy phones so expensive they consider $100 like a quarter you find on the street. so this was a pretty good value. I got mine for $100 even though it was not the ad supported version. Not sure how that happened but I'll take it. I do wish manufacturers would standardize on button positions because every phone I have to retrain myself for where the power and volumn buttons are. this one is exactly opposite than my last phone Another requirement for me is battery life. So far it has been great. I don't play games, only stream a few hours a week, very little GPS and generally use it as home on wifi. Out of the house it is just a phone and email tool. I don't use Facebook or Snapchat which I understand are battery killers. One night it didn't charge because I didn't realize the charger had been unplugged. It lasted until the following evening so nearly two full days. That works for me."
57320,THANK YOU!! iPnone 8 plus is in perfect condition. Arrived on 25 Jan. 2019.
4525,"I bought this phone for use in Jamaica, it suppose to be international version and factory unlocked. the phone is partial unlocked, I can put my Digicel sim in the phone and it work for most features. but the ONE and only that I care is not working! INTERNET SHARING. I can't turn it on. It say I should goto ATT.com or call 611 to enable this device for tethering. I don't have account with ATT&T, how the hel* I goto att&t to change the setting? This is suppose to be international version FACTORY UNLOCKED. for God sake. What Am I going to do now? Update: Got it work using the instruction from the seller. I give it 4 star rating."
13970,"Excellent equipment, very practical and functionalNokia C5-03 Unlocked GSM Phone with 5 MP Camera and Ovi Maps Navigation Optimized for AT&T--U.S. Version with Warranty (Graphite Black)"
23132,what can i say. it works. thats all i need. no troubles
76261,"Absolutely love this phone, if it hadn't come in a plain white Box I would never have known it was a renewed phone. It doesn't have a scratch on it and works like new. At this price point I think It's a great deal. The only thing I was a little disappointed in is that it didn't come with any earbuds at all, Samsung or otherwise."
26784,Worked from the get-go. Can't believe I have been buying my phones from this dang providers for 3 times the amount. Putin sim card and followed the instructions... Flawless. Great buy!
23778,"Absolute waste of $150. After 8 months it is nearly completely unusable. The immediate downside was the size - half the storage is taken up by the System, so you can have a maximum of about 10 apps before the phone is maxed out (this is with NO music and minimal photos). Even put a 64G memory card in but the apps dont transfer so you're still stuck with minimal storage space. Buttons started failing after just a few months, freezing, and at about 7 months unable to recieve texts. Changed carriers to try and remedy the problem, 3 carriers later it is the phone. Camera not even as good as my last 3 phones although it claims higher megapixels. Size and screen are nice, other than that total cheapo phone that breaks after a few months."
54205,Very good mobile but network poor somehow device don't catch good network tower
33882,"The Sony Xperia X is an ok device. Here's what I liked and dislike about it and why. Basically, I had to go back to my old device. Likes: - Beautiful, sleek, metal design. Although the back of the phone doesn't feel very sturdy. - Pretty compact and easy to carry around. - Stunning display, with colorful and rich tones throughout. - Very good camera with a nice amount of features. - Came with a minimal amount of bloatware. Dislikes - Battery life is pretty horrible. This is the first device in a long time where I wasn't confident I could get through the day without having to carry around my travel charger. - Lacks features that even mid-ranged devices have these days: + No fingerprint scanner. It's disabled in the US variant of this this device but enabled everywhere else in the world. + Limited phone features like reverse lookup and a decent blocked call or text setup. - The tap to wake feature is finicky. Either you have to tap hard or it doesn't come on at all. Either it's too sensitive or not sensitive enough. - Has front facing speakers that aren't very loud. - Screen doesn't turn on when I get a message of any kind. Only the notification light will blink. - Camera doesn't remain in the settings I left it on. It keeps defaulting to the auto settings. - If the phone gets warm or supposedly overheats, the camera will give you an error message and will shut off. I have never seen this on any phone I've used and I've used many. - Not integrated enough with Google for my liking. - Overpriced especially considering the features it lacks. What I liked about the phone actually prompted me to keep this phone longer than I would normally have. While this phone is not terrible and is perfectly acceptable for the casual user, I don't feel comfortable with this phone being a reliable, daily driver due to its shortcomings."
31201,"I was replacing a damaged phone I had which also was a Galaxy x7. Could have upgraded but I loved my old phone and knew this one would be the same. I was correct, this phone is perfectly restored and Couldn't tell between it and a brand new one."
67983,"Good phone for a good value - no complaints except for the miscommunication about fingerprint capabilities. This phone has facial recognition but NO FINGERPRINT SCANNER. Everything I found online indicated it should until I spoke directly to Samsung. There are so many versions of this phone, it's very confusing."
1015,"I have to admit that I went by reviews in choosing this phone, and did not to proper research, other than reviews. I bought two of these obsolete Windows phones. They both have battery issues. They overheat and do crazy things. They overheat to the point that they may be dangerous. They came with no warranty, which should have been a red flag. MY FAULT!! That having been said, save your money!!!!!! Do research on issues in the geek blogs, not on reviews, which are not reliable. I even called Samsung for support and had to talk to several people before I got to someone who even knew anything about this product Incidentally, this phone and some other models of Samsung Smart Phones are notorious for BLOWING UP! Caveat Em tor, Baby! 'Nuff said!"
1033,"the title of this product is unlocked phone, but at the pictures of this phone, i can see very well the logo of AT&T on the top, i can not understand why the pictures include AT&T, but finally, i love this phone, the original price was $399, but right now is $109, MMMUUUUAAA AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH"
38640,This model F8331 is advertized as LTE howeverI had to order three separate F8331 model phones to get one that was 4G LTE compatible. First two only works on limited number of GSM frequencies not 4G LTE. Inspected in person and confirmed by T-mobile staff.
43520,My first non-flip phone. Learning slowly but love it.
24493,The delivery was perfect but when I got the phone didn’t work.... I had to order another one from a different website it was a gift for my mom and I was already out d the states. Whoever I dealt with for he phone was nice just waiting on my refund
76333,Would really like this phone if the reception was not so poor. It's not much good when you can't get a signal and Motorola does not seem to be addressing the issue.
40235,"iPhone shipped fast and appeared to be in very good condition. Is limited to 4G only, LTE does not work on this phone. It seems to be a hardware issue according to my service provider and apple support. Works good enough, not worth the time to return and try again."
72431,"Decent phone, seems to manage everything I throw at it, and it has an amazing camera for the price point its selling at. All in all a really decent low budget phone."
63624,As described. Shipped by fed ex. Included an adapter for us plugs. Very happy.
59377,"My two previous smartphones were Alcatels, so for me, this Xperia L2 is a big improvement. I am a lightweight smartphone user, so this does everything I want, and fast. I use it to talk, text, facebook, shop, research, locate, and I use the camera a lot. Setup was simple- pop in my sim card (same size) from my previous phone, stick in a sd card, turn it on and go. It connected cleanly and quickly. It grabs and hold wifi when roaming, bluetooth for printing, etc. The screen is clear and bright, and the phone audio is loud enough and clear. Video is good, and the sound is pretty good, too. I use earbuds for music. I use Amazon Prime's photo storage, so I can access my images on all my devices. I have only one concern, and that is the charging is erratic. I have had it show me the charging symbol only to check in the am and it never charged. Most of the time it charges fine, but that just worries me a little. Otherwise, I love this phone."
47373,"Received unlock, I was so excited. Nice camera quality."
40571,Use it every day for my personal phone an where I go the phone goes
8917,Great phone great price does everything the note 2 does but better.
14465,"My Wife and I both have these phones for a while, here are my thoughts... We like the phones in general, the operating system is great. All the standard stuff we like... battery life is good, camera is good, touch is good, feel is good. We have both dropped the phones may times and never had a issue with the screen. We do have a cases on the phones so this must be the key. The bad... Motorola advertises these phones as water resistant... I dont see how they are. My wife recently dropped this into the sink just for a quick splash. quickly turned it off and we put it in rice. I figured since it was such a quick dip it would be fine, but it wasnt! The screen is completely dead! I've had smart phones that took a trip in the bottom of the pool that werent water resistant and recovered. This is completely outrageous that Motorola would boast that these were water resistant and then can even survive a quick partial dip in the sink. When i was shopping for phones it was between this and the Galaxy S5... I thought the water resistance would be similar.... I was dead wrong. I dont know if I'll ever go with another Moto product again. I loved my original Samsung Nexus and I regret going with the google owned Motorola. I think i may have to give the S5 a try now since hopefully my wife wont water log it."
7572,"Had the Convoy 2 for 3 years, and was impressed with the sound level, specially from having other flip phones that were hard to hear incoming calls from another room. Convoy impressed me. Than went to the iPhone 5S smartphone, and after 7 months with one, I missed the Convoy, and decided I'm not a kid that needs a smartphone, sold it for a profit, than got the Convoy 3, and well pleased with it. Like the better 2.5 mm head phone jack if I wanted to speak with someone longer (Headset) without having to have the phone next to the ear. Sound quality is very good, rugged so having one placed in my front pocket is never an issue, as well as dropping one it won't break. I use it as a phone and have a computer at home for the other stuff. One issue with the Convoy 2, was that from time to time, the phone would turn off after the second year, and didn't know why. Did a google search, and found a fix for it. The battery would come slightly loose, and would not make contact, which caused the phone to turn off. Simple fix for everyone would be to cut a business card to the size of the battery, place the card on the battery, and put the back cover on. Wa-La...Fixed the issue. Unknown if this one will have same issue down the road but now I know how to handle it."
61293,The phone would not stay on for any period of time. It would just go off and cut on and go right back off. Could not use it.
57174,"Nothing to complain about. Clean, undamaged phone with an acceptable after-market charger and cable. All work well. I bought the phone for app testing (I'm a developer), and it does the job. I'm spoiled by larger more versatile droids, and this is a very small phone by comparison. I bought an iPad Air for the app testing, too, and I will say that voice to text on the iPhone is FAR more accurate than it is on the iPad Air....where it's pathetic. My droids have always been exceptional at voice to text. All in all, if you're looking for an iPhone, I'm VERY happy with the value proposition on this purchase. I definitely got a very nice phone for a modest price."
19070,It is a great phone. Very easy to transfer all my contacts and apps from my old Galaxy S3 and works great with Cricket Wireless.
7189,I'm very pleased with my Phome! It arrived on time and was exactly as stated in the add.
55306,The phone is not unlocked international. I had to get it unlocked so I could use it in the carribbean
44348,"The phone seems to be fine other than no where in any of the sellers descriptions of the phone do they say that the phone is unlocked. So I have no idea if it is or not. The battery life from the very first is horrible. The battery is not efficient at all. In my opinion if you but something like a cellular phone the battery should be brand new, this one was definitely not. Even the white dot on battery that is supposed to detect and indicate moisture was PINK when it arrived. You dropped the ball on the battery boys."
34744,"In the item description includes earphones, wall charger and cable, than at the order details it's a note that says no earphones and the wall charger will not be original. Now I have the buy more than $60 in accesories. I am so returning this mock!"
32681,I would actually buy 3 more from this dealer but none have been available. Almost like new. One scratch on the home button. The S7 is amazing. Was about to give up on Samsung after the S6 was released. This phone definitely brought me back around.
1932,"If you want a basic cell phone that also takes pics, texts, wakes you up in the mornings, alerts you when to take your meds. plus provides a handy calender, calculator, stop watch, and voice activated....This is the phone for you."
29661,"Works perfectly fine, I was able to easily install my GSM card"
9396,Best thing since sliced bread.. ...I luv my galaxy note 3!!!! No matter what you throw at it.....the speed and power knocks it outta the ballpark.....I was an Apple head but now I've been galaxized!!!!!
77067,"The phone honestly didn't stroke me by way of design. My sister and I bought new phones the same day and when she unboxed her Huawei y9 I was in love with how sleek it looked compared to the standard looking Moto G7 power. But once I turned this phone on it had been pure love. It's very smart, very sturdy in my hands so it doesn't fall easily as I'm clumsy. Great features and battery life is amazing. That suits me well. Coming from HTC I'm feeling no remorse over the switch"
76232,"I've owned the Mi Mix 3 for 5-6 months and I have developed a love hate relationship with this phone. I want so much to love it and except for one massive issue I do. The sad part is the massive issue is becoming a deal breaker and after i test it on other carriers and see no change it'll force me to purchase a different phone or reactivate my old phone. The issue is that cellular signal strength and connectivity wise this is the worst phone I've ever owned. I cannot maintain a signal for any period of time when stationary. Now this isn't entirely the phones fault as I am on t-mobile (metro) and almost equidistant from two towers. Given t-mobiles notoriously bad building penetration of their LTE signal and my rural location and the aforementioned tower locations I'm sure they share some blame. That having been said the problem is my other phones have been on the same network. As well as my daughter's phones. I've owned ZTE phones LG phones and the phone before this was a Huawei mate 9. My daughter has owned essentially the same devices except for when I bought the Mate 9 I bought her a pre-owned iPhone7. Since buying this phone I continually have to go in via the dialer code to set networks in order to stop the phone from constantly switching from LTE to 4g (3g but it's listed as 4g on this phone as 3g is outdated) which takes an eternity for it to finally grab a signal. It goes through every possible band several times before connecting to either the 3g signal or reconnecting to LTE. Neither myself or my daughter get even close to full bars but we can be sitting next to each other and I'll have a -118 - -127db signal strength and she will be at -100 - -110db. A prime example of how bad this phone is as far as signal goes is at the airport she had full bars of LTE and I had no service. That having been said I'll now delve in to the overall review. Build quality is amazing. And it is absolutely a stunner and conversion piece. You want your friends to lust after your phone this phone will do it. Not only because of the slider since other phones have more impressive solutions for hiding the camera (oneplus7 for instance) though it does turn heads. But the real attention grabber is the ceramic back. However I feel this beautiful part of the phone may be the causation of the connectivity issues (I could be wrong it could just be poor build quality in terms of antenna design but it's the first phone that isn't plastic or metal backed and it's the first with the issues as bad as this one has). The slider is rugged and I've no doubt that it will last as long if not longer than Xiaomi has stated. The screen is gorgeous and nearly 100% which is why I picked this phone. Performance is on par with flagships for the most part only falling slightly short but it's to be expected being priced at half the cost of the big guys. Miui is actually not a bad UI. I did root mine but haven't flashed a custom rom and I use Smart Launcher 5 in order to keep the screen clear of any icons widgets dots or any other items as I love a clean home screen. Overall I believe this is an amazing phone but probably best suited to someone in a city setting who doesn't venture out of the city very often if ever. Living in a rural area as I do makes this one of the most frustrating experiences I've ever had. Obviously this phone is already outdated and will soon become obsolete once 5g is nationwide but if you want a quality built phone for a dang good price and live in a city or area with a strong cell signal, you'd be hard pressed to find a better option. For what it's worth I'd suggest the jade green it's absolutely beautiful though the ceramic back is slick and a fingerprint magnet. The includes case, while being cheap plastic, does a very good job of making it grippy. The wireless charger that is included is one of the best included accessories I've ever seen. Not super expensive but a nod to giving the customer the tools to fully utilize the phone as it is intended instead of creating a profit system built around having to buy peripherals and accessories to put the phone to proper use. I'm definitely impressed with Xiaomi and their dedication to building quality products at reasonable prices. I just wish I could give this a 5* but the signal issue is a massive problem. If I get it sorted and it turns out to be a network issue or operator error I'll happily bump it to 5*."
78033,"Great phone, I think best out there right now, but they could have made the fingerprint reader easier to use. However it has face recognition and that is awesome."
41160,"""Earpods not included."" Yes, now I see that at the end of the small letters text, they actually do note that on the product page. Let's just say after going through dozens of refurbished iPhone pages reading small script is not big on my list. ""Earpods not included"" not being more obviously stated on the page (in bold, or at least first thing in the description) is my only complain though. The iPhone itself was in good condition, which IS the most important thing. It would be a five star review if I did not feel somewhat cheated by (and embarrassed for not noticing) the small print tricks. But I guess everybody uses those nowadays, so it's ok, right? Update: The phone turned out to be locked! After several months when I took it out of the country and tried using it with another operator it does not work because apparently it is still locked."
32182,"Seller sent me a locked phone, even though it was advertised as unlocked. Carrier unlock code wouldn't work, and the manufacturer said that's a sign the device was modified in the past (possibly rooted). Very unhappy. Will not buy from this seller again."
6651,I really really love it. I'm from Philippines and use it with my local SIM card. I wish I could get 32G but 16G is only available in Amazon. In moto website the unlocked developer version is the better choice for me since it is 32G but they don't accept foreign credit cards. This is not available in my country yet or never will be. I love the touchless control. No other android device can do that. I know you can download third party apps for same function but it drains the battery like hell. With moto x separate chip for touchless control battery is not an issue. I love the active display. I need not to unlock the phone to check incoming messages or other notifications. It shows on the screen when I pull out the phone in my pocket or just get it from the table…. I was deciding between Nexus 5 and Moto X. Thoug N5 is beast on paper but the functionality of Moto X really works for me. I use it all the time when I'm driving my car.... best phone in history….
29278,"Worked right out of the box, not a single scratch or dent, as I it was purchased from the Apple store itself."
3971,"The phone is an expensive phone and after one month of usage, the phone doesn't power on. It's just ridiculous."
40474,Worst phone ever.... The phone will not keep a charge to save its life..... Don't purchase from this seller just out to take your money and make a profit.
1972,"Good price. First experience with Android. At present the phone is smarter than I am. Still trying to figure out how it works. Sometimes it does not respond like I think it should. Wish it had three main features all together [call] [receive a call] and [voice mail]. These are not clearly together and the other features get in the way. For the price, not complaining just explaining."
39132,"Perfect condition, like new. Took almost a week to ship. It is locked but I simply called TMobile and they unlocked it for free in 24 hours. It is an awesome phone so far. Also this is the first refurbished phone I've purchased that included a brand new charger. Packaging and quality are equivalent to purchasing a new phone, I love it!"
32013,"It came quickly and looked new outta the box, I just couldent get used to using android again so I decided to return it to buy a iPhone"
5966,"There are a number of great things about the Galaxy S4, but the huge problem with it outweighs them. After having my phone for only a few months, it stopped recognizing the SIM card. I took it to the store, replaced the card, and it had the same problem. It would reset itself again and again and I could barely get it to work long enough to call AT&T customer service. The did send me another one since I was within warranty. Now the replacement I have is doing the same thing, except it absolutely will not recognize the SIM card. After reading online about the issue this is a relatively common one to this phone. No matter what else there is to recommend it, if you can't depend on it to recognize the SIM (which determines whether you can make phone calls or receive a network data signal) it is worse than useless, it's somewhat dangerous because you could be relying on it to work at a critical time when it decides not to. I absolutely will not get another Samsung phone, period."
41205,"The Touch ID doesn’t work with the phone, and people can hardly hear me on the phone half of the time, they say I sound really really far. I considered returning the phone in the beginning due to the Touch ID, and I wasn’t aware that the quality of my phone calls was bad until later. But I still didn’t want to return it b/c I’m scared that the new phone would have a possible worst defect than what I have currently. It’s dealable but annoying. Besides those two things it works like a charm. Even though it’s a good deal it’s still super expensive to purchase something and it not even be of 100% quality"
33328,"All in agreement, I received the product and it is as it appears in the description, of the announcement. I loved. SONY is maximum and great brand.Thank you"
42467,"A really good phone overall. Fast processor. I can not get rid of the Verizon apps and controls on it, though. Maybe it is due to my lack of knowledge. I had a lot of difficulty switching carriers to Tracfone. Took over an hour with a tech at Target store doing it for me over the phone."
27546,My daughter got this for her 16th birthday she was so excited
13343,"It's listed as ""new"" however after two months of use the charger port stopped working. Brought it in to get fixed and the repair guy commented on how poor the wiring was set up within the phone and how he couldn't access the charger port because the screen was practically glued to everything. Long story short, my phone is now properly assembled with new screen, charger port, the works. Thought I was buying a ""new"" phone; as page suggests, but instead got a poorly refurbished one. Tried contacting someone regarding the matter about a week ago and have yet to get a response. Disappointed in the false advertisement of this item and the lack of customer support from the seller."
18345,"The phone itself meets expectations, however, it lacks a sim card; consequently, it doesn't work!"
52832,5 Stars- I was a bit worried. Perfect Condition. Great phone. Stated TMobile and Is TMobile. Not a scratch on the phone. Very pleased. It arrived in a plain box. The charger and cord were not Samsung; I do not mind. They work just fine.
37892,Received wrong phone got pixel not the XL n seller refused to compensate me even a lil bit
48841,"It has one major problem, the charging is sucks maybe 24 hours charging not enough to get 100% battery"
28182,Works great brand new just like the old one I had but a lot less coin
42532,"So far this is well worth buying. Looks brand new, everything functions properly. Glad I took a chance on a refurbished phone."
8430,"Horrible. The phone did not work, I had to buy another one."
30072,"Phone freezes all the time, screen goes black and is unresponsive to anything other than a soft restart. I can't go more than an hour without a freeze. Also the charger came broken."
76079,After setting up right and identifying it to sites it works great. Any time you get a new phone even with the same phone number it takes time to get it right. Same with my new Samsung tablet.
62367,"I am very impressed with this device. My previous phone was a Samsung Note 5, and this phone is every bit it's equal or better. The battery life is excellent, I don't charge at all during the day, and the battery has never dipped below 70% by the end of the day. When I'm on call I am on the phone almost all day and it has almost no impact on the battery life. I have played music for 8-10 hours and still had tons of battery left. I'm not a big gamer on my phone, so I can't talk about how that would impact the battery."
5999,"I remember when curly cords were the big innovation in phones. When I could no longer avoid a cell phone I just assumed that a basic phone would be easier to operate. For years I struggled with that stupid little thing, I couldn't find it, couldn't see it, couldn't hit those tiny buttons with my big fingers and since all the apps were extra and I didn't know what they were for, I didn't purchase any. When it rang I thought what's that weird noise? At the insistence of techno-savvy friends I made a leap into the 21st century and purchased a Samsung Galaxy S4 smart phone and my life is forever changed. It is easy to see and operate, all the apps are included and make sense; it's a little computer in your pocket. You can ask it where to get a good BBQ sandwich and not only do you get a list, it takes you to the one you pick. If someone calls while you are driving, you don't have to answer...it will tell you in a clear voice who is calling and ask if you want to accept the call. Say no and it tells the caller you will get back with them later. It's a calculator, flashlight, radio, alarm clock, video camera and remote control. You can dictate messages, watch television, movies and listen to your favorite old rock and roll. You can pay your bills, see the person you are talking to (or not), read books and magazines, buy coffee at Starbuck's, translate foreign languages and take a ""selfie"". It reads those squiggly squares and plays games when you are bored...and that's just what I have figured out in a short time. It watches your face and doesn't turn off if you are looking at the screen. It does this really fast and the battery lasts all day. The pictures are crystal clear and you can make the font bigger so you can see it. I know there are lots of folks laughing at this review because it is pretty naive but there are still people out there who will read it with a sense of relief. Yes, Samsung has made a phone we all can use and understand and when pulled out in public it doesn't look like a compact or a candy bar. I love this cell phone and I think it loves me too."
54479,"Very good phone for that price, the battery lasts almost 2 days of regular use."
29201,The phone works perfectly and gives me the option of changing carriers or using overseas by simply changing the SIM card.
72722,"I mostly care about 2 features in a phone: battery and camera. This phone excels in both. The camera is about the best as reflected in the DxOMark rating and the battery can easily last me 2 day. The chip set has excellent performance, I think easily beat Snapdragon 845 on my Oneplus 6t. The display is beautiful, but not too crazy about the notch. I'd rather they just black out the top band. Overall, very happy with this purchase at this price."
17309,Outstanding phone. Beautiful display. Almost pure android experience. Super-fast. Only criticism is that the camera is just so-so.
17484,"Very upset with this order. When I bought it, it said it was for t-mobile. When turning on the phone, it's an AT&T phone. Dings all over the phone, pixels on the screen are messed up in the lower right corner, did not come with headphones, came with regular wall charger port not fast charge one. Box was damaged and also had a crack on screen.Overall expectation was terrible. Will not buy again. Definitely contacting seller"
2799,"Great little phone... I was hesitant to get this phone after a few neg. reviews, but nothing like that. Shows some people can't be trusted. The phone has been with me over two weeks. Looks and works great as expected. Battery lasts about 4 days with WiFi, Bluetooth Off. These options consume battery, especially WiFi while driving, since the cell tries to connect to all the roaming WiFi channels. The RAZR M is small and fits on the hand easily. There are tons of good and cheap cases for it. The Screen is brilliant and sharp, better than the my other Gallaxy S-3. The voice during a call is much more discernible than the Galaxy. I always had issues with it because of that. The outer camera is top of the line. The inner camera is described as super low res, but I found it good enough even for minor selfies, but don't expect much in low light. WiFI is as any other phone. I recommend this RAZR M phone."
45617,I purchased this phone for my wife in early March but then she got sick so didn't get it to the Verizon store till late April. Verizon told us it was not a verizon phone and not even an Apple but a cheap Chinese clone. Now it appears too late to get a return.
62026,I think this is an amazing phone I love it. I would recommend
67577,"This phone is awesome for the price range. It feels good and has a quality finish which adds to the 1 of many things I like about this phone. Highly Recommend UPDATE!! Been using this phone for a couple of months & I STILL love be it. The camera is awesome and I have had no issues will the lag of regular system updates. The AndriodONE works effiently. This phone is the best for for YOU for the price. When the next version comes out, I will be upgrading."
41893,"As a technophobe I put off buying a smart phone but finally had to. This phone is so easy to use, so light and responsive that I'm sorry I didn't buy one years ago."
34875,It came in great condition and worked w/o any problems.
27661,Reordered because the 1st phone was broken. Second phone is also broken. Don't waist your money
3105,"I bought this phone for my 17 year old son. It is nice like my husbands regular sized droid razr, but a bit smaller. My son likes the smaller phone. It has a great look to it and the screen looks really nice."
62786,"I bought this phone to replace my wife's samsung with a cracked screen. After two months she loves it. The sim card from samsung fit right in, switching over (on verizon) was very easy. She loves the camera and says it everything is easy to use, and she gets a better connection than before. We even added a memory card and she listens to audiobooks from the library while driving. All in all, it was a very good choice for medium level smartphone."
5249,This phone does not work at my job. I was trying to call my daughter from work and it went dead...I mean no connection at all...so I just had it disconnected. I have internet at home WiFi and this phone will let you get online and search on it too without any issues but I still say I waisted my money on this phone.
79041,This phone is truly amazing! I loved it so much the only odd thing is the shape of it but it has to have that shape for it to have the perfect screen fit for Netflix and amazon prime and other online video app. The camera is insane good and it’s amazing that this phone have HDR.
20681,So far it’s a winner! Great Christmas gift for my 11yr old!
71588,"My daughter loves her new phone! It didn't come with the earbuds, but I realize that it was not brand new."
9385,Price couldn't have been better. Great phone and let me determine for a reasonable amount that I want the Note 4 and hand this one down.
19710,The battery charge is ineffecient and drains too rapidly even when not being used.
32123,Screen burn on it! Looks like two rows of micro SD card pictures burned on screen. Battery uses about 1% per minute! That's not what listing said!
82457,"I brought this for my father in law because he doesn't like the iPhone anymore and we are looking for something like the same but finally, we found this for a cheaper price. The main feature which my father like most is its face id. He feels easy and free for use face id to unlock this phone. Other things I have not observed yet because he is using this phone from the beginning but he said he loves this phone.."
21554,This phone is absolutely amazing the best phone I've ever had
11972,appears to have been taken apart and put back together as the screen seems to be coming apart from the body of the phone
7190,"The product was delivered as expected in great condition. The problem was my fingers, LOL, when I went to Best Buy to purchase a protection cover, I dropped the phone and broke the screen, making the phone unusable. No worries, I had the phone fixed and all is well."
80819,"This phone's battery is like a tank. It can last up to three days with normal use like texts or answering social media messages. It has been a few weeks now with this phone and it is great. It can send gifs and has a decent speaker for how much you buy it for. The facial recognition feature is great and for the fingerprint reader it can be a little annoying but it works. It may not be able to read the fingerprint too fast and need to hold it for a split second longer. Overall, great phone if you are looking for a phone that will last forever"
32706,"I'm very happy with this phone! The most efficient Android I've had so far, without having to spend ridiculous iPhone money."
72618,Everything was perfect for the first couple weeks however happening more often than not I don't know where the screen starts semi bleeding so it's not permanent from any impact it just starts blurring in different colors and I have to end up restarting the phone for it to subdue and sometimes it comes back anyways so hopefully that will go away
39997,A co-worker asked me to help buy a reasonable good smartphone for a low price. After a bit of reviewing phones online I settled on this one for her. She is very happy with it.
54702,"great value, I only need a few apps and email... this fits perfectly for both price and functionality. easy to set up, easy to use.. great phone"
8527,Phones works but some of the sensors do not work on the front and the phone lags.
11056,"Now, let just start off with saying I was a hardcore Apple fan, loved my iPhone 5C, until it was stolen while I was on a layover in Seattle. So, after hours of research on this phone, I finally made the decision to get it. Primarily because it was free. I can't tell you just how much windows has improved. This thing is very user friendly, I figured it out in a matter of hours. I love the fact that it had a 13 MP camera on it. Now, with the Windows 8.1 OS they have fixed the shutter time. Which makes this phone 10 times better. The pictures I am able to capture are awesome. I live in Hawaii and do a lot of swimming and hiking and... well I live in Hawaii there's going to be a multitude of picture taking. The high resolution screen is great. Colors really pop. The battery life is pretty good, I use my phone a lot at work and throughout the day. 10 - 12 hours later it needs to be charged, 8 hours if I'm playing music constantly. Also the Kid's corner, I swear it's one of my favorite features, I have a 4.5 year old and let me tell you the Kids Corner was a God send when we had a 9 hour flight. I love the live tiles and being able to personalize my phone more than I could with my iPhone. I've always like the quality of phones Samsung has put out. This is a great phone. The only downfall is that the Windows app store is not up to par with Google Play and the App Store. That's just windows, though. I still think this is the best phone on the market, and I gave the iPhone 6 a test run when my dad upgraded. I like my phone better. I would definitely recommend this phone to anyone."
15762,"The screen was scratched all over, the headphone jack was broke and the flap broke off in like two weeks. The phone malfunctions every other day it freezes up. I wouldn't recommend buying a phone unless it say like new because there opinion of good condition was much different than mine."
74429,"I just recurved the phone. The box is stained as scratch. The main menu when the phone boots, is in Spanish. The packaging doesn't look original. Update ... After further investigation, it seems that's just how they package the phone. The phone feels to be off great quality and fast in performance. Battery send to charge at good all micro USB speeds I'm going to continue testing the phone. So far, it's working great with T-Mobile in LA County. From what I investigate, it has all of the main Bands used my T-MOBILE, with the exception of Band 71 (600MHz) which is only critical in rural areas, it seems, and not in big cities. Phone did a regular update, to Pie 9.0, which is the latest Android version. I don't give it 5 star, cause of the micro USB charger"
44928,"This phone is not dependable. For the following reasons, after not even a month of usage, a) MOST of the time, calls are forwarded to a voicemail, b) camera does not focus every time, it has to be restarted or some time has to go by since last blurry picture for the camera to be able to gain focus again, and c) media volume is very low, it is hard to hear, even with the media volume at 100%. I figured it would be a good phone since I do not use it most of the time. Battery life can last for about 5-6 days for me, that is how often I use the phone. However, besides, calls being forwarded to a voicemail, I am unable to place a call successful, every time. For example, when I place a call, it looks like it is fine, the phone shows 'calling' on the screen but I cannot hear ringing at all. Sometime, I have to try a couple of times to make a successful call. Besides, it gets scratched very easily. Its quality is worse compared to for example any one of the Moto G phones I had previously. However, the screen on this phone seem to be good. I had purchased Honor 8 and returned it thinking that I will be fine with this lesser quality phone. But I was wrong, I purchased Honor 8 again and I placed a return order for this phone. Honor 8 is the most flashy (but very fast and well build phone) phone and it is worth buying and right now it is similar price as this phone. Doesn't make sense to keep this phone."
2079,"Nice phone at a nice price. The only reason I didn't give it a 5 star was the screen, not very good when outdoors. All in all, good phone , great os."
44829,"I have no idea if it comes with the screen card already inserted, but the mobile is really in a good condition and I really like it."
18625,Sometimes it gets a pink line on the screen and the charger that it came with did not work Other than that it's cool
66660,"Having spent 4 years with my previous smartphone, the search for its successor would be a long and calculated one. I am a very simple smartphone user, as I am not a heavy gamer nor am I a multimedia editor, though there is nothing wrong with being either. I wanted a phone that would have a generous battery life, a great screen, expandable storage, and more or less, a good camera. Being a college student however, I would need all of these features to be within my budget. Ever since I bought I last year, I use it every day and have never once regretted buying it. The fingerprint scanner is also a nice addition! Thank you for your time, and good luck with your buying process!"
38730,"The camera stopped working a day after I bought it, and I had a similar problem with the Xperia Z3. I couldn't believe I got the same bad luck with this model and the whole reason I wanted this phone was for the camera. I brought it in to be repaired, still under warranty, and the camera stopped working 2 days after. I stopped using the camera and stopped bringing it in to be repaired because it wasn't worth the effort. Now the sim card reader doesn't see my sim card and I can't do anything with my phone. I have to send it in for repairs since the Sony helpdesk looked at it and don't know why it won't work. No warranty now of course so it would cost me a pretty penny to do so. I gave Sony two chances and both phones were awful. So disappointing."
16461,"it was long time ago, but very satisfied with the purchase"
903,i really liked the phone i had already had a similar one before so i really liked so decided to get another one... its really good and better was the price... i would recommend it..
60178,"My previous phone was the moto z play and I feel this was a nice jump. -Fantastic battery life, I usually get 7-9 hours of screen on time if I'm using it a lot in 1 day. Otherwise it'll last for atleast 2-3 days easy. -It charges super quick with the included charger. -No headphone jack but there is a included adapter and a pair of headphones. -Accessories aren't as abundant as they would be for a Galaxy phone or iPhone. - the camera is pretty good. Most shots look great! - Huawei's skin is mostly good. - no microSD slot but you're getting 128gb internal storage out of the box. - No wireless charging. If you really care about that. -The speakers work alright. If you're looking for something different then your typical brands I'd recommend it."
1008,"This phone is a waste of money. It lasted only 3 months before it started malfunctioning. It constantly restarts (between 5-13 times a day), which can be very annoying as it will do it at random - in the middle of phone calls, playing music, heck, while it is laying perfectly still on a desk charging overnight. DO NOT GET THIS PHONE!!! Don't just listen to me though, just do some research and you will see just how many problems this phone has."
29031,Product did not come with wireless charger nor did it come with the S-pen so can not fully enjoy phone features
61517,"I've used it for a few weeks now, the build and hardware seems to be in good condition but I've noticed that all my calls when using LTE just keeps dropping continuously. It seems like the bad data connection was the reason this phone was returned. I am usually in an environment where I have access to wifi so it hasn't bothered me too much yet, and that is why it took me a long time to realize the problem, but It is definitely a significant one. The camera is very good quality but there's something wrong with the display of the phone. Compared to my last phone (Moto G5 Plus) the display quality seems low, not in resolution (of course) but in colors. The phone seems to have a light but permanent orange tint in its display, no matter what I do with the display settings. I have compared the display with all of my other laptops, monitors, tv, and older phones with same pictures. So, buyers be careful. You might end up with a good phone or really crappy ones. From the ratings, it seems like a lot of the people either got good phones or choose to ignore the problems because it didn't bother them too much. For me, I travel from time to time and need a good data connection, so its a bummer, also as an artist with intermediate skills the display is starting to bother me so much that I decided to write a review. Update: The fingerprint scanner works about 20% of the time, i would say."
59088,"I recently switched from a Samsung Galaxy Note 4 to the Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra Factory Unlocked Phone, and use Tmobile (which I have been with for 11 years) as my service. I love the phone itself. The size, single action fingerprint unlock on the back, battery that easily lasts two days with my usage, low amount of bloat (especially compared to Samsung), ability to block notifications directly, and fast responsiveness from the OS and apps. Some people don’t like that it’s heavy and square-shaped, but I liked the shape and the weight didn’t bother me. It’s a phablet, so is to be expected. The phone as a device--other than calling--easily gets 5-stars from me. But here’s the problem: Calling. I had three major calling issues on T-Mobile: 1) The call quality is muddy/muffled. Apparently, the phone does not support VoLTE (voice over LTE). Which means it uses LTE for data like surfing the web, but switches to 3G or lower when on a call. As a result, the call quality is muddy/muffled in comparison to what I am used to with LTE on the older Note 4. While the sound is tolerable from mobile to landline, mobile to mobile is dreadful. 2) Sometimes calls go straight to voicemail rather than ring the phone. Often the call doesn't even show up on the call history (I only know it came though if the caller leaves a message). It's an intermittent issue; maybe happens 20% of the time. But I never had this happen on the Note 4 and I live in the same area. From chatting with T-Mobile support, it sounds like the issue is related to the lack of VoLTE—sometimes calls get lost when the device has to switch from LTE to 3G. Assuming they are right, to get calls as often as possible, you can force the network to use GSM only, but that’s 2G, which is even poorer quality and the data is extremely slow. 3) The call volume on Bluetooth headsets is very quiet. Sometimes I can barely hear what the person on the other end is saying. I have both the call volume and Bluetooth volume maxed. The volume is fine when listening to music; it's only quiet during a call. I tried multiple Bluetooth headsets, including LG HBS-1100 (I own two and tried both), LG HBS-820, Jabra Elite 45e, and several other off-brands. All had volume issues. A problem I never experienced on my older Note 4. Things I tried: 1) I fully reset the phone and set everything up again. 2) Ran it in safe mode. 3) Fully updated the phone. 4) I returned the phone and got a replacement; same problems. 5) I removed my case as suggested by Sony support. 6) I checked signal strength, and it stays solid between 3-5 bars, so that isn’t an issue. I spent many hours scouring the web and talking to support to find a solution, but none worked. T-mobile did suggest a mini-tower device called the 4G LTE CellSpot, which they provide with a deposit of $25 plus shipping. It connects to your internet, assuming you have high-speed. Even though the phone does not have WiFi calling, it sorta acts like it does. Your device will not see this as a Wi-Fi connection as the 4G LTE CellSpot creates an actual signal for the phone like a tower. Supposedly. I decided not to try it out myself. I’ve had bad experiences with VoIP technology in the past. The drawback (other than consuming more electricity and internet bandwidth) is that it only works within a 3,000 square feet broadcasting distance. So it doesn’t solve any issues when away from home. In the end, I returned the Sony Xperia XA2 Ultra (for a second time). It’s an amazing device when used for anything but calls, but fails miserably at the phone department (at least with T-Mobile under my circumstances). Unfortunately, that’s kind of an important feature in a phone. Ended up biting the bullet and paying for a T-Mobile phone directly from them (OnePlus 6T) rather than taking my chances on another unlocked one. This way I know for sure it’s fully compatible."
57902,No se prende el cel y está súper mal estéticamente quiero que me devuelva mi plata 😩
60529,"I finally had the will power to ditch the Samsung Galaxy line after 8 years and it was a great decision! I received this phone about 2 weeks ago and wanted to wait to review it after my trip to San Francisco. It did not disappoint at all, the camera is fantastic. It consistently outperformed my wife's iPhone 8 plus in every situation, low light, high contrast and zoom. What most impressed me was the battery life! I was on my phone from 7am to about 8pm and the phone still did not die from the heavy usage. The 4000mh battery is now gimmick. I was constantly taking pictures and videos of my kids, researching eating spots, snapchatting all day and posting to Facebook and Instagram. I was thuroughly impressed! There are only a couple concerns I can think of with this phone, not having wireless charging, now I don't use it nearly as much as my wife does but it was available with the previous model so I don't see why it wouldn't be available with the mate 10 pro. And for some reason I initially had a slow WiFi connection. After a system update and a reboot it seemed to go away but comes back every now and then and I have to turn off the WiFi and then turn it back on. But my T-mobile service was constantly outperforming the WiFi which should not be the case. I think with a patch and update this problem should be non existent in the future, internet still works well and this should not deter you from purchasing this phone for nearly half the price of a Galaxy s9 or s9+."
41982,Item arrived in perfect condition and just as described.
9230,"not sure if the antenna is weak in this phone, or the att service is bad in my area, but i got horrible reception on this phone. it worked just fine when reception was good though. and it weighs as much as a feather. if you need a cheap phone for now, get this phone. i wouldnt recommend it for long term use. also, consider another phone if you text alot. texting on a keypad is annoying and strenuous."
59551,"I bought this phone in October and the charging port was a little loose. After the 3 month warranty, the audio no longer worked from the port and 6 months later the phone no longer takes a charge. It costs $200 to fix a port on the Pixel 2."
8755,Was new really. Just 2 chips in the chrome. The rest brand new
57421,Awesome! I’ve had this phone for over a few months and it’s still working as if it is new
60231,"I own this phone for about 10 days. So far it works great. I found one small issue when I was installing a new screen protector. There are minor scratches on a screen. Usually I don't see them, but when I inspected carefully the screen when it was dark, I found them. I used the phone some time without any screen protector, but I used it very carefully and I highly suspect the scratches were from the very beginning. I don't have much concern about them, but be aware if you ant a perfect product - when you peel the factory screen protector, inspect the screen carefully."
55780,A great phone but I would advise buying it directly from the Google store. It's much cheaper there.
56514,"I love the design and perfornance. I have received an excelent Smarphone, you will love it and S pen is really usefull. The S pen was not in the phone, I contact the seller and he sent me a replacement. You will receive only a generic charger maybe."
5215,I have been only taking this supplement for two months. What I can say it's that my skin does not have bad break outs any more and my lashes and eye brows are fuller. But that's it I haven't noticed a difference in my hair yet. We will see. only time will tell.
65603,"The cellphone did not come with all the accessories. The ad says it comes, even though they are generic."
26539,"Phone came to me with a chip in the top right of the screen, which was not mentioned accurately in the description. Battery life was extremely poor from unboxing, and the charging equipment provided was not fit for the phone and doubled charge time. A few months down the road, the phone barely works. It takes me two or 3 minutes to send a snapchat due to the phone crashing, the keyboard crashes mid-sentence, and the phone frequently gets so frozen on the lock screen that it cannot be opened for hours on end. What an expensive paper weight."
25983,This is a great phone but I got the black 64gb verizon one and it didn't come with the fast charger
73725,"I got to say this is the most beautiful phone i ever owned it has some heft which i like and a deep finish . It felt like a sin covering it up in a clear case. This is the first time this happened to me on any phone but i got the ""Black Screen Of Death""how I dont know . I later learned the apps could cause this. I plan on getting another Note 9."
50309,"I bought this in June and was super happy with it at first. However, now it is only September and already my microphone and headphone jack don't work. I tried to take it somewhere to get it fixed, but it is going to cost so much to fix that I might as well buy a new phone. A phone that only lasts for 4 months is certainly not worth it."
26964,"This Samsung Galaxy 4 is different from the Galaxy 3 cell I had prior to this phone in a couple ways. The camera in my opinion is brighter and takes overall more flattering pictures than this Galaxy 4. I have had it for a while now and I notices the camera makes every picture darker and less vivid in colors. The darks are dark but the same could be said for the Samsung Galaxy 3 phone I had. I had research this cell phone prior to purchasing it all over the internet from written reviews to videos. Alto every review did note the difference in the camera between the Galaxy 3 and 4 I could not figure out if the camera was better or worse based on the technical aspects. Yes this phone technically takes more saturated and pixelated pictures, technically! BUT if you like taking selfies this phones camera in my opinion is not as flattering as the Galaxy 3. I have had this phone now for a bit almost 2 months and perhaps there is a little more to learn about the camera that can make me change my mind but thus far the camera is not what I had drew me to the galaxy 3 in the first place. I thought the camera would be similar just better with the mega pixels and zoom. As for video it is pretty good. The darker camera is not that noticeable but then again I didn't take many videos with the Galaxy 3 and haven't taken many with this Galaxy 4. Now as for the rest of the cell phone overall. Once again technical mumbo-jumbo is one thing the actual hands on feel and use of a product is one thing. The phone is slightly bigger than the Galaxy 3 and I do mean slightly. Therefore upgrading to this phone from the 3 based on size is not worth it at all. The speed is the main reason if your in the market to upgrade from the Galaxy 3 is what I feel you will notice the most. This phone can handle multiple web pages and apps open if your an average smart phone user like me. On top of the capabilities of this phone you would think battery life would be draining but the battery life on this phone compared to the Galaxy 3 is super not to mention the charger time is much quicker. The charger is 2.1 and does not charge well with any thing less. You'll be happy with the charging time. Also if you need to restart your phone and dread having to wait for the start up time you'll be happy to know turning this phone on takes very little time in comparison to the 3. One other aspect I noticed is the smooth feel to the screen on this phone. It feels like a highly polished glass screen your figure will just glide across it. Phone calls are what Ive come to expect from Samsung Galaxy phones. The clarity is great and the simplicity of the calling application has not been changed. The speaker is clear and enjoyable to listen to when placed down against a hard surface. Granted its not a high price Bluetooth speaker but is a bit better than the galaxy 3 speaker and even that speaker was decent. Overall I like the phones speed, processing, and feel, The camera can be better in my opinion. Since my Galaxy 3 broke and I needed a newer smart phone that wouldn't be hundreds of dollars I took a chance on the Galaxy 4. It feels like a upgrade and it is for me I just wish the camera was similar in vivid colors as the 3 but oh well. If by chance I find the secret to taking better pictures with this camera I will edit is review."
53931,I truly love y phone it was in great condition and very sleek and nice for a price that’s in my range. Also it was sent before the delivery date😍.
79148,"Bought from Russ Cellular. Works with T-mobile. The phone came in a different box but in excellent like new condition. The phone works great and runs fast. Came with a non-fitting probably apple iphone tempered glass installed but it works temporarily and protects the screen. Was comparing the oneplus 6t with a used samsung galaxy 9 before I bought, and still this saved some more money and I think likely runs faster because of OxygenOS being fairly stock. Also, based on my previous phone usage I didn't think I needed expandable memory (128gb is enough). Just didn't want to spend over 500 for the newest line 7 pro or samsung 10 or 10+."
